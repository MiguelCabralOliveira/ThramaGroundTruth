    "enhanced_request": "Enhanced research brief \u2014 Investment analysis of the Pennsylvania multi-let light industrial sector\n\nObjective\nConduct a comprehensive, investor-focused market analysis of the multi-let light industrial (small-bay/multi-tenant industrial and business-park) sector in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania as of the current market cycle (data through 2026-01-06). Treat \u201crecent trends\u201d as the prior 12\u201324 months (calendar 2024\u20132025) and provide forward-looking forecasts and investment recommendations for the next 3\u20135 years (through 2028 and through 2030).\n\nScope and definitions\n- Geography: Statewide Pennsylvania with submarket breakdowns for major metros: Philadelphia/Camden subregion (including Southeastern PA), Lehigh Valley (Allentown/Bethlehem/Easton), Reading, Lancaster, Harrisburg/Carlisle, Scranton/Wilkes-Barre, Pittsburgh, Erie. Note key highway/grade corridors (I\u201195, I\u201176/PA Turnpike, I\u201178, I\u201181, I\u2011476, I\u201179) where relevant.  \n- Property type: Multi-let light industrial / small-bay industrial \u2014 typically multi-tenant buildings with unit sizes ranging ~1,500\u201350,000 sf, low- to mid-clear height (often 16\u201328 ft), dock/drive-in configurations, yard/storage where applicable, used by last\u2011mile logistics, wholesalers/distributors, trade contractors, light manufacturing, and small e\u2011commerce operators. Segment analysis by unit size buckets and by asset age/quality (modern vs older product).\n\nRequired analytical components\n1. Executive summary (1\u20132 pages)\n   - Key findings, recommended investment stance (core/core+ vs value\u2011add vs opportunistic), target submarkets, expected return bands, and principal risks.\n\n2. Market-size & growth\n   - Total existing inventory (sf) statewide and by submarket.\n   - Annual net absorption (sf) and inventory growth for last 5 years, with emphasis on 2024\u20132025.\n   - Historical and projected rent levels ($/sf/year NNN and gross), rent growth rates, and rental vacancy rates (gross and effective) by submarket and unit-size bucket.\n\n3. Supply & demand dynamics\n   - Current supply pipeline (under construction, permitted, planned) in sf by submarket and expected delivery dates.\n   - Construction starts and completions last 24 months, plus land availability and development constraints.\n   - Tenant demand analysis: leasing activity, tenant types and size demand, lease term lengths, renewal rates, and churn. Identify major demand drivers (e\u2011commerce, reshoring, manufacturing, nearshoring, last\u2011mile) and any weakening/strengthening trends in 2024\u20132025.\n\n4. Investment yields & capital markets\n   - Transaction volume (count and $) for multi-let light industrial in PA for last 24 months, key recent transactions and comps (address, size, submarket, price, $/sf, cap rate, buyer/seller).\n   - Market cap rate ranges by submarket and asset quality and cap rate movement trends (most recent 24 months).\n   - Typical financing terms available (LTV, pricing/spreads, amortization, investor/debt appetite), debt market constraints, REITs and private capital activity.\n   - Valuation drivers and pricing sensitivity.\n\n5. Cash-flow metrics and modeling\n   - Provide pro forma ranges: typical NOI margins, expense loads, typical leasing commissions and TI allowances for small-bay multi-tenant industrial.\n   - Scenario IRR/NPV and sensitivity analysis for rental growth, vacancy, and cap-rate shifts (stress tests: +100 bps cap rates, -100 bps, interest-rate shifts of +/- 100\u2013200 bps).\n\n6. Major players and competitive landscape\n   - List institutional owners, large regional operators, active private equity/REITs, and brokerage teams active in PA multi-let light industrial (with brief notes on strategy and typical deal size).\n   - Identify local owner\u2011operators and common owner concentration by submarket.\n\n7. Risks & mitigants\n   - Enumerate key investment risks (economic slowdown, oversupply in specific submarkets, rising construction/operating costs, interest rate/financing risk, obsolescence, regulatory/tax issues, environmental/industrial zoning constraints, labor availability) and practical mitigants (adaptive reuse, unitization, active leasing, rent indexation, targeted capex, diversification by unit size/tenant mix).\n\n8. Regulatory, tax, and incentive context\n   - Summarize landlord- and tenant-relevant regulations in PA (zoning, environmental permitting, property tax considerations), and any relevant state/local incentives (enterprise zones, tax abatements, industrial development authorities) that affect development or occupancy.\n\n9. Future outlook & forecasts\n   - Provide 3-year and 5-year base, upside, and downside forecasts for vacancy, rent growth, construction starts, and cap rates by submarket.\n   - Investment return outlook under each scenario and recommended hold periods.\n\n10. Investment recommendations & strategy\n   - Tactical & strategic recommendations (preferred submarkets, target unit sizes, reposition/value-add plays vs buy-and-hold core, deal structures, target entry prices/cap rates, expected hold period, exit strategies).\n   - Due diligence checklist specific to multi-let light industrial in PA (environmental, zoning, structural, tenancy, electrical/ceiling height adequacy for modernization, drainage/yard surfaces).\n\nDeliverables and format\n- Written report with the sections above (20\u201330 pages recommended, executive summary up front).\n- Data appendix and tables: inventory by submarket, vacancy/rent time series, pipeline schedule, transaction comps (last 24 months).\n- Financial model in Excel: pro forma, scenario analysis, sensitivity tables (rental growth, vacancy, cap rate shifts, financing terms).\n- Charts: rents, vacancy, deliveries, transaction volume, cap-rate trends, submarket maps.\n- Sources and methodology: list primary data sources used (CoStar, RCA, CBRE/Colliers market reports, local assessor records, building permits, industrial brokers) and any assumptions.\n\nSpecific metrics to include\n- Inventory (sf), net absorption (sf), vacancy (%), asking vs effective rents ($/sf/yr), rent growth (% YoY), average lease term (yrs), concessions (months/%), transactions (#, $), sales volume ($), avg $/sf sale price, prevailing cap rates, under-construction sf, starts/completions, construction costs $/sf, typical TI and leasing commission per sf.\n\nTime horizon and scenarios\n- Historical review (2019\u20132025) with focus on 2024\u20132025 trends.\n- Forecasts for 2026\u20132028 (3-year) and 2026\u20132030 (5-year), with base, upside, and downside scenarios and clearly stated probability/assumption for each scenario.\n\nOther instructions\n- Prioritize primary market data where available; clearly flag estimates or modeled inputs.\n- If data gaps exist for any submarket, state them and propose reasonable proxies.\n- Deliverables should be suitable for a capital allocation committee presentation (i.e., clear conclusions, data-backed recommendations, and an Excel model).\n\nIf you want, I can also:\n- Narrow the brief to a single submarket first (e.g., Lehigh Valley or Philadelphia MSA) for a deeper dive; or\n- Prepare a short investment memo (2\u20133 pages) instead of the full report. Which option do you prefer?",

Conversely, the regional \nunemployment rate rose somewhat, increasing by 30 basis points (bps) YOY, \nsettling at 4.1% \u2013 though remaining below the national average. \nSUPPLY AND DEMAND\nThe Corridor\u2019s regional vacancy rate increased by a modest 20 bps quarter-\nover-quarter (QOQ), driven by several mid-range tenant vacancies \u2013 200,000 to \n600,000 square feet (sf) \u2013 and ending Q2 at 7.4%. Despite the modest move-\nouts, leasing activity increased 68.2% QOQ, and year-to-date (YTD) net \nabsorption rose by almost 200,000 sf. New quarterly leasing activity surpassing\n100,000 sf was led by third-party logistics and food/grocery firms, demonstrating \nthe region\u2019s diversity of industrial enterprises.  \nCONSTRUCTION\nThe region\u2019s construction pipeline continued to even out, with total YTD \ndeliveries contracting by 37.9% YOY to 3.3 million square feet (msf) \u2013 with over \nhalf of this space delivering preleased \u2013 and the expected construction pipeline \nthrough year-end 2025 is on pace to deliver 15.4% less new space than 2024. \nOf this upcoming space, almost exactly a quarter is preleased, and nearly every \nsubmarket has at least 2.0 msf of construction underway, totaling 12.9 msf. \nOUTLOOK\nAs continued economic instability drives myriad business sectors to exercise \ncaution in new capital investment, new challenges for industrial real estate \nplayers are likely to emerge. However, the Corridor remains flexible, as a \ncontracting construction pipeline and improved leasing activity are expected to \nhold asking rates steady. Regardless, economic uncertainty remains, at least in \nthe short-term. Longer-term timelines may eventually lead to increased \nwarehouse investment in the Corridor as businesses look to reshore and adapt \nexisting supply chain networks. Near-term decision-making will likely remain \ncautious as businesses navigate a capricious economic situation.\n-5\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n2021\n2022\n2023\n2024\nYTD 2025\nMillions\nNet Absorption, SF\nConstruction Completions, SF\n0%\n2%\n4%\n6%\n8%\n10%\n$2\n$4\n$6\n$8\n$10\n2021\n2022\n2023\n2024\n2025\nAsking Rent, $ PSF\nVacancy Rate\n\n\n2\nPROPERTY\nSUBMARKET\nMAJOR TENANT\nSF\nOWNER/DEVELOPER\n1035 Locust Point Road\nCentral PA\nSpeculative\n527,755\nHillwood\n403 South Chiques Road\nCentral PA\nSpeculative\n399,280\nPanattoni\nPROPERTY\nSUBMARKET\nSELLER/BUYER\nSF\nPRICE / $ PSF\n21 Roadway Drive\nCentral PA\nLink Properties/LBA Logistics\n1,058,700\n$139.0M / $131.29\n3490-3510 Board Road\nCentral PA\nBradley Realty/Presbyterian Development\n145,278\n$7.0M / $48.18\n540 Western Maryland Parkway\nI-81S\nWestern Hagerstown/County Commissioners\n109,544\n$8.5M / $77.59\n2 Maxson Drive\nNortheastern PA\nNortheastern Envelope/Ennis\n75,115\n$3.6M / $48.14\n1118 Susquehanna Trail South\nCentral PA\nBel Connector/Genesis Turf Grass\n73,500\n$5.3M / $71.84\nPROPERTY\nSUBMARKET\nTENANT\nSF\nTYPE\nHazleton Logistics 141\nNortheastern PA\nRJW Logistics Group\n1,058,483\nNew Lease\n105 Willow Springs Lane\nCentral PA\nGlaxoSmithKline\n624,000\nRenewal*\n700 Nestle Way\nLehigh Valley\nRR Donnelley\n548,405\nRenewal*\n2040 North Union Street\nCentral PA\nGrocery Outlet\n507,000\nNew Lease\n575-595 Research Drive\nNortheastern PA\nUNDISCLOSED\n403,000\nNew Lease\nMARKET STATISTICS\nKEY LEASE TRANSACTIONS Q2 2025\nKEY SALES TRANSACTIONS Q2 2025\nKEY CONSTRUCTION COMPLETIONS 2025\n*Renewals not included in leasing statistics\nRYAN HULL\nSenior Research Analyst\nTel: +1 215 963 4041\nryan.hull@cushwake.com\n\u00a92025 Cushman & Wakefield.

Conversely, \nthe regional unemployment rate increased by 50 bps since midyear 2024, rising \nto 4.7% and surpassing the national average. \nSUPPLY AND DEMAND\nIndustrial leasing activity underwent significant growth throughout the \nPhiladelphia region in Q2 with nearly 3.7 million square feet (msf) of quarterly \nleasing, driving the market total to 6.6 msf year-to-date (YTD) \u2013 a 61.9% YOY \nrise. An unprecedented eleven new transactions greater than or equal to \n100,000 square feet (sf) were signed during Q2. Burlington County penned the \nmost notable improvement in vacancy, dropping 640 bps YOY and concluding \nQ2 at 7.6%. \nFurthermore, Southeastern Pennsylvania has wholly reversed last year\u2019s \nnegative absorption trend, settling at 1.4 msf of positive net absorption YTD. \nCombined with Southern New Jersey, the market recorded nearly 1.9 msf of net \nabsorption for the quarter and 3.2 msf YTD. This marked the strongest mid-year \nnet occupancy gains recorded since 2021. The region\u2019s construction pipeline \ncontinued to level out as anticipated, as midyear construction completions \nincreased by 360.6% YOY and future development should continue to wind \ndown.\nOUTLOOK\nAs economic uncertainty is likely to persist into the second half of 2025, the \ncore fundamentals of the Philadelphia industrial market \u2013 including strong \nworkforces and enthusiastic consumers \u2013 will preserve the region\u2019s resilience \namidst said uncertainty. Asking rents \u2013 which grew 2.8% YOY in Q2 \u2013 are \nexpected to hold firm through to year-end and may even exhibit further growth \nas the region\u2019s construction pipeline contracts and vacancy rate growth \nstabilizes.

      "KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\u2022\t Demand remained resilient in the first quarter despite tariff uncertainty. The \nU.S. industrial sector continued to absorb space in the first quarter, registering \n23.1 million square feet (msf) of positive absorption. This was down from 42.4 \nmsf observed in the fourth quarter but on par with the level absorbed in the \nsame quarter one year ago.  \n\u2022\t Vacancy continued to drift higher to 7%. The combination of vacant \nspeculative deliveries and some occupier dispositions caused the U.S. \nindustrial vacancy rate to rise by 30 basis points (bps) to 7%. After remaining \nhistorically tight for several straight years, vacancy is now back in line with the \nhistorical average\u2014indicative of a more balanced market.   \n\u2022\t Rent growth continued to moderate. Rising vacancy continues to take some \nof the pressure off rents. In the first quarter of 2025, rents grew by 4.3% year-\nover-year (YOY) but were flat quarter-over-quarter (QOQ). Moreover, a rising \nnumber of markets reported YOY declines this quarter. \nDEMAND STILL RESILIENT\nDespite trade policy uncertainty, the U.S. economy continues to absorb a healthy \namount of industrial space. In the first quarter of 2025, net absorption registered \nat 23.1 msf, on par with the total reported one year ago. Warehouse and logistics \nspace was the standout product type this quarter, absorbing 30 msf. Conversely, \nmanufacturers gave space back to the market on a net basis, resulting in 5.7 \nmsf of negative absorption. The flight to quality trend continues. In the first \nquarter, the newest industrial space (product built after 2023) accounted for \nmore than 57 msf of net occupancy gains. Conversely, older facilities with limited \nfunctionality experienced more move-outs than move-ins, resulting in over 33 \nmsf of negative absorption. \nIn terms of total deal volume, the market remains active but slowed in the first \nquarter. New leasing activity totaled just under 140 msf in completed deals \nduring the first quarter, marking a 6.4% decline YOY. Larger occupiers (100,000 \nsf and greater) remain attracted to newly built buildings that offer higher clear \nheights, more efficient space designs and tenant amenities. Industrial buildings \nconstructed since 2020 accounted for 60% of the deal volume for leases of this \nsize range in the first quarter. Across all deal sizes, third-party logistics (3PL) and \nmanufacturing fueled demand, contributing to approximately 51% of first-quarter \nleasing.  \nSPACE DEMAND / DELIVERIES\n0\n200\n400\n600\n800\n2021\n2022\n2023\n2024\n2025 YTD\nMillions\nNet Absorption, SF\nConstruction Completions, SF\nOVERALL VACANCY & ASKING RENT\n0%\n2%\n4%\n6%\n8%\n$0\n$2\n$4\n$6\n$8\n$10\n$12\n2021\n2022\n2023\n2024\n2025\nAsking Rent, $ PSF/NNN\nVacancy Rate\n\u00a9 2025 Cushman & Wakefield\nUNITED STATES\nINDUSTRIAL Q1 2025\nM A R K E T B E AT \n7.0%\nVacancy Rate\n23.1M\nNet Absorption, SF\n270.8M\nUnder Construction\n4.3%\nRent Growth, YOY\n$10.11\nAsking Rent, PSF\nOutlook\nYOY  \nChg\n(Overall, All Property Types)\nECONOMIC INDICATORS\nMARKET FUNDAMENTALS\nOutlook*\nIndustrial \nEmployment\n43.3M\n159.1M\nTotal Nonfarm \nEmployment\n4.1%\nU.S. Unemployment \nRate\nYOY  \nChg\nSource: BLS, *Cushman & Wakefield baseline\n\n\n\u00a9 2025 Cushman & Wakefield\nUNITED STATES\nINDUSTRIAL Q1 2025\nM A R K E T B E AT \n2\nVACANCY RISING, MIDWEST EXHIBITS SIGNS OF STABILIZATION\nThe U.S. industrial vacancy rate increased 30 bps QOQ to 7.0%, marking its highest \nlevel since 2014. The quarterly rise was driven by over 45 msf of vacant speculative \nstock that delivered in the first quarter, as well as some space returning to the \nmarketplace. Approximately two-thirds of the 83 markets tracked by Cushman \n& Wakefield reported quarterly vacancy increases in the first quarter. Smaller \nwarehouses (less than 100,000 sf) continued to post the tightest vacancy rates at \n4.1%, while big-box facilities (over 250,000 sf) have seen vacancy rates swell above \n10% over the last few quarters due largely to healthy new speculative supply totals. \nASKING RENTS START TO FLATTEN AMID SOFTER MARKET CONDITIONS\nAlthough industrial rents continue to appreciate at a reasonably healthy clip \noverall\u20144.3% YOY\u2014a rising number of markets reported rental declines this quarter, \nkeeping the average U.S. rate steady at $10.11 per square foot (psf) since year-end \n2024. Nearly 40% of the U.S. markets tracked by Cushman and Wakefield reported \nannual rental rate declines, as some landlords have responded to softer demand \nconditions and higher vacancy rates. Also, the composition of available stock has \nshifted due to recent speculative construction trends as big-box facilities make up \nmore of the total stock available, affecting the weighted average for asking rents.   \nAlthough rent pressures have eased slightly, many markets have seen rents surge by \nmore than 50% over the last five years. As a result, occupiers that inked deals more \nthan three years ago and have leases expiring in today\u2019s market are still facing a \nchallenging rent rate market. Rent dynamics are also nuanced in terms of both size \nand class. Smaller industrial product (less than 100,000 sf) has maintained above-\naverage asking rents over the last few quarters, hovering in the $12-$15 psf range, \ndue to tight market conditions in this size segment.\nPIPELINE GRADUALLY THINNING, QUARTERLY DELIVERIES REACH  \nLOWEST POINT IN FOUR YEARS\nJust 72.6 msf of new industrial buildings completed construction in the first quarter \nof 2025, a 41% YOY decline and the third straight quarter that completions trended \nlower. Speculative assets made up 72% of the square footage delivered. The \n100,000-300,000-sf size segment accounted for 35% of the quarter\u2019s completions, \nwith 10 facilities greater than 1.0 msf completed, six of which were build-to-\nsuit. Meanwhile, the construction pipeline fell by 33% YOY, ending the quarter at \n270.8 msf. Of the total, 34% are build-to-suit, in line with year-end (33%). Though \nthe pipeline has continued to thin out notably in the West and Midwest regions, \ndevelopment activity and has ticked marginally higher  in the South since the close \nof the year. On the market level, 23% have had their construction totals fall by 50% \nor more YOY, and just five markets now boast pipelines of 10 msf or more, down \nfrom 12 markets one year prior.\nOUTLOOK\n\u2022\tThe implications of new tariff \npolicies will likely be felt \nthroughout the industrial sector \nif they linger. Port volumes will \nlikely slip after the frontloading of \nimports subsides. Some occupiers \nand manufacturers will likely seek \nto mitigate the costs of tariffs by \ndiversifying supply chains and \nsourcing parts and goods from \ncountries that have lower tariff \nrates.\n\u2022\tNew construction starts may \ndecrease due to volatile material \nprices and uncertain tenant \ndemand, leading to a declining \nconstruction pipeline which will \nhelp preserve occupancy at \nexisting industrial assets.\n\u2022\tIf inflation starts to rise again or \nrecession jitters emerge, the U.S. \nconsumer could pull back on \nspending, which would negatively \nimpact industrial demand going \nforward. This is a key trend we are \nclosely monitoring.  \n\u2022\tAs of the first quarter, the engines \nthat drive industrial demand \nremain mostly solid. E-commerce, \n3PL activity, and the potential \nboost in domestic manufacturing \nand reshoring should help offset \nsome of the fallout from the new \nhigh-tariff environment.\nSPACE UNDER CONSTRUCTION\n0\n200\n400\n600\n800\n2021\n2022\n2023\n2024\n2025\nMSF\nWAREHOUSE CONSTRUCTION STARTS\n0\n100\n200\n300\n400\n2021\n2022\n2023\n2024\n2025\nMSF\nQ1\nQ2\nQ3\nQ4\nNEW LEASING ACTIVITY\n0\n200\n400\n600\n800\n1,000\n1,200\n2021\n2022\n2023\n2024\n2025\nMSF\nQ1\nQ2\nQ3\nQ4\n\n\n\u00a9 2025 Cushman & Wakefield\nUNITED STATES\nINDUSTRIAL Q1 2025\nM A R K E T B E AT \n3\nDEMAND INDICATORS Q1 2025\nNet Absorption \nLeasing Activity**\nU.S. Industrial Markets\nQ1 2024\nQ2 2024\nQ3 2024\nQ4 2024\nQ1 2025p\nQ1 2025p\nAtlanta, GA\n1,472,195\n3,534,469\n-466,851\n1,845,316\n511,089\n6,675,269\nAustin, TX\n2,492,345\n574,456\n241,658\n1,021,537\n1,342,895\n1,700,382\nBaltimore, MD\n-162,425\n-547,559\n240,703\n75,995\n455,535\n712,241\nBirmingham, AL\n54,993\n-137,773\n116,475\n431,316\n68,247\n275,596\nBoise, ID\n556,445\n588,948\n613,670\n235,046\n-231,184\n446,347\nBoston, MA \n228,541\n-8,493\n-115,433\n-128,606\n-492,918\n526,431\nBuffalo, NY\n-592,232\n-178,130\n204,233\n-253,617\n-493,616\n279,691\nCentral Valley, CA\n58,081\n959,964\n1,405,070\n-1,951,553\n-1,458,690\n268,496\nCharleston, SC\n-915,786\n-729,268\n31,560\n-45,535\n768,779\n698,327\nCharlotte, NC\n320,205\n1,815,255\n1,058,001\n578,291\n835,210\n3,909,497\nChicago, IL\n3,634,348\n2,113,876\n4,313,558\n338,375\n1,473,928\n6,067,432\nCincinnati, OH\n-1,050,450\n-154,457\n671,081\n685,138\n260,829\n1,310,396\nCleveland, OH\n56,274\n1,489,394\n683,302\n127,197\n601,643\n1,157,357\nColorado Springs, CO\n-129,757\n-59,925\n194,751\n109,649\n102,469\n77,017\nColumbia, SC\n966,274\n-125,232\n389,959\n-514,772\n-369,030\n5,313\nColumbus, OH\n-343,888\n732,527\n1,329,737\n-3,439,151\n2,476,414\n4,609,044\nDallas/Ft.

      "I-81/78 Corridor Industrial Market \nOverview\n2Q25\n\n\nNEWMARK\n\u2013 As of May 2025, the unemployment rate in the I-81/78 Corridor was 3.9%, which is 10 basis points below the \nnational average. Traditionally, employment trends in this region have mirrored national patterns. Recently, \nhowever, the region's employment growth has decelerated and is now lagging behind the national average. \nOver the 12 months leading up to May, employment in the I-81/78 Corridor decreased by 1.3%, in stark \ncontrast to the 1.1% increase observed across the nation.\n\u2013 Industrial-using employment saw annual growth in two out of its three industries, resulting in a total increase \nof 33 basis points over the 12 months ending in May. Other Services, Education & Health, and Financial \nActivities sectors were the leaders for annual employment gains in the Corridor through May. The Other \nServices industry sector comprises establishments that do not fall into any other specific industry and tend \nnot to be industrial-using employers. The top three sectors employ nearly 30% of the region\u2019s workforce. \n2\nMarket Observations\n\u2012 So far this year 3.1M SF of industrial space has been delivered. While this represents a 45.6% decrease \ncompared to the average for the first half of the year since 2018, it is still a substantial increase over the first half \nof 2024, which saw only 590,402 SF of new deliveries. Quarterly absorption registered at -1,786,985 square feet \nthis quarter. While this figure appears considerable, it's important to note that approximately 73.2% of the \nnegative absorption resulted from Big Lots\u2019 bankruptcy. As a result of the bankruptcy, Big Lots vacated \n1,295,000 square feet at 50 Rausch Creek Road. Despite this substantial negative absorption, the vacancy rate \nfor the quarter remains within 15 basis points of the long-term average.\n\u2012 Construction starts have accelerated rapidly since the beginning of 2025, fueled by nearly 5.3 million square \nfeet of groundbreakings this quarter. Notable projects include Prologis\u2019s development of 1.1 million square feet \nat 7600 Linglestown Road in Harrisburg and Matrix Development Group\u2019s construction of a 900,000 square foot \nfacility at 7000 United Drive in Shippensburg. Both properties remain fully available. The 7600 Linglestown \nRoad project is scheduled for delivery in mid-2026, while 7000 United Drive is anticipated to be completed by \nthe end of next quarter. \n\u2012 Between the fourth quarter of 2024 and the second quarter of 2025, the annual average asking rent experienced \nan increase of 1.2%. The increase was largely fueled by greater overall availability in the Class A warehouse \nmarket, along with new construction deliveries scheduled for 2025. These new properties are commanding a \nweighted average asking rate of $13.32.\n\u2012 In the second quarter of 2025, at least one of the top five largest leases signed occurred within each of the \nthree I-81/78 Corridor submarkets. These large leases trended towards a variety of companies, including \nLogistics, Food and Beverage, Manufacturing, and Life Sciences.\n\u2012 The most significant transaction of the quarter was the RJW Logistics lease for the entire 1,058,483-square-\nfoot, newly-built Hazleton Logistics Center at 450 E Gardner Highway. The building delivered this past \nFebruary, and RJW Logistics signed in May, but is not expected to move in until the beginning of next March.\n\u2012 Sales transactions remained active in the Corridor for the second quarter of 2025, with 9 deals closing for a \ntotal of just under $33.6M. The largest transaction of the quarter in terms of square feet occurred at 2211 \nMemorial Highway, a 696,960-square-foot flex building in Dallas, PA. The property was sold in April by Offset \nPaperback Manufacturers to Sordoni Properties.\n\u2012 Class A warehouse leasing activity fell this quarter in response to lower-than-average overall leasing activity. \nSince the first quarter of 2019, Class A warehouse leasing has captured 42.3% of total leasing activity on \naverage. Despite this period of below-average activity, Class A leasing has historically remained strong. As a \nresult, the current slowdown is expected to be an outlier rather than a sign of a longer-term trend. In fact, tenant \ndemand remains robust, with nearly 7 million square feet of space sought in the market and 41.5% of active \nuser requirements representing new entrants to the region. Features like higher clear heights, wider column \nspacing, and increased power capacity are particularly appealing to industrial users transitioning to more \nautomated and power-intensive operations. \n\u2012 Although leasing activity over the past few quarters has been below average, it does not undermine the market's \nfundamental strengths. The I-81/78 Corridor continues to benefit from its strategic proximity to major ports in \nPhiladelphia, New Jersey, and New York. The Corridor also has the advantage of being in proximity to large \npopulation centers and an industrial labor pool that accounts for nearly a quarter of the region's total workforce. \nEconomy\nLeasing Market Fundamentals\nMajor Transactions\nOutlook\n\n\nNEWMARK\n1.

Since 2019, the gap between \nClass A asking rents and taking rents has fluctuated from as low as -$0.12 per square foot to as high as $1.04 per square foot.\n\n\nNEWMARK\nPlease reach out to your\nNewmark business contact for this information\n20\n\n\nNEWMARK\n2Q25\nMarket Statistics\n\n\nNEWMARK\nChart Title\n22\nSource:  Newmark Research\nSubmarket Overview\nSubmarket Statistics \u2013 All Classes\nSubmarket Statistics By Subtype\nTotal \nInventory \n(SF)\nUnder \nConstruction\n(SF)\nTotal\nVacancy\nRate\nQtr Net\nAbsorption\n(SF)\nYTD Net\nAbsorption \n(SF)\nQtr Construction\nDeliveries\n(SF)\nYTD Construction\nDeliveries\n(SF)\nTotal \nAsking Rent\n(Price/SF)\nTotal Class A\nAsking Rent\n(Price/SF)\nCentral PA\n217,829,510\n5,094,436\n8.1%\n34,412\n(35,422)\n527,755\n1,385,402\n$7.59\n$7.87\nLehigh Valley\n163,365,695\n2,139,174\n8.1%\n(446,381)\n(738,505)\n0\n84,909\n$9.91\n$10.16\nNortheastern PA\n100,322,558\n458,800\n8.7%\n(1,374,966)\n(1,046,015)\n209,919\n1,614,902\n$6.96\n$7.05\nI-81/78 Market\n481,517,763\n7,692,410\n8.2%\n(1,786,935)\n(1,819,942)\n737,674\n3,085,213\n$8.45\n$8.82\nTotal \nInventory \n(SF)\nUnder \nConstruction\n(SF)\nTotal\nVacancy\nRate\nQtr Net\nAbsorption\n(SF)\nYTD Net\nAbsorption \n(SF)\nQtr Construction\nDeliveries\n(SF)\nYTD Construction\nDeliveries\n(SF)\nTotal \nAsking Rent\n(Price/SF)\nTotal Class A\nAsking Rent\n(Price/SF)\nGeneral Industrial\n125,278,772\n3,226,223\n5.8%\n39,413\n522,226\n737,674\n2,275,804\n$7.91\n$8.83\nR&D/Flex\n13,938,003\n0\n3.6%\n10,317\n136,354\n0\n0\n$10.55\n-\nWarehouse/Distribution\n342,050,988\n4,466,187\n9.3%\n(1,836,665)\n(2,478,522)\n0\n359,409\n$8.49\n$8.82\nI-81/78 Market\n481,517,763\n7,692,410\n8.2%\n(1,786,935)\n(1,819,942)\n737,674\n3,085,213\n$8.45\n$8.82\n\n\nFor more information:\nMarcus Lisse\nResearch Analyst\nGreater Philadelphia Research\nmarcus.lisse@nmrk.com\nNew York Headquarters\n125 Park Avenue\nNew York, NY 10017\nt  212-372-2000\nnmrk.com\nPhiladelphia\n2005 Market Street, Suite 900\nPhiladelphia, PA 19103\nt  215-561-8300\nKing of Prussia\n1000 Continental Drive, Suite 200\nKing of Prussia, PA 19406\nt  610-265-0600\nCarolyn Bates\nDirector\nMid-Atlantic Research\ncarolyn.bates@nmrk.com\nLicensed in Pennsylvania as Newmark Real Estate\n\n\n",
      "Greater Philadelphia Industrial Market \nOverview\n2Q25\n\n\nNEWMARK\n1. Economy\n2. Leasing Market Fundamentals\n3. Market Statistics\n2Q25\n2\n\n\nNEWMARK\n\u2012 The Greater Philadelphia economy has exhibited sustained strength over the 12 months ending in \nMay, highlighted by a decline in the unemployment rate to 4.0%. This rate now matches the national \naverage. Notably, throughout the past year, Greater Philadelphia consistently reported \nunemployment rates below those of the overall U.S., underscoring the region\u2019s economic resilience \nand ongoing growth. Additionally, annual nonfarm payroll employment rose by 1.3% during this \nperiod, marking the fourth consecutive year of positive 12-month growth. The region\u2019s largest sector, \nEducation and Health Services, remains the primary engine of employment growth, underscoring its \nvital role in the local economy.\n\u2012 Other Services, Education & Health, and Government sectors each grew by at least 140 basis \npoints for the 12 months ending in May. The Other Services industry sector comprises \nestablishments that do not fall into any other specific industry and tend not to be office-using \nemployers. These top three growing sectors employ about 40% of Greater Philadelphia\u2019s labor \nforce. Strong annual employment gains in these sectors are encouraging for the region\u2019s economy.\n3\nMarket Observations\n\u2012 The industrial construction pipeline has declined significantly, with 9.8M square feet at the end of the \nsecond quarter of 2025, a 3.4M  square foot decrease from the previous year. A notable share of the \ndecrease in the construction pipeline is the result of planned industrial developments at the \nKeystone Trade Center being redirected for data center use.  Over the last 8 quarters, there has \nbeen an average of just under 3.2M square feet of quarterly deliveries. This reduction aligns well \nwith the current slowdown in demand for new bulk facilities. \n\u2012 Sublease availabilities declined to 3.1M square feet. Southern New Jersey accounts for 1.3 million \nsquare feet of sublease space\u201441.3% of the market\u2019s total\u2014despite making up only 28.2% of the \nregion\u2019s overall inventory.\n\u2012 After annual declines in rents in 2024, asking rates have now risen by 5.5% to reach their all-time \nhigh of 11.78/SF. Growth in asking rents has mainly been fueled by the availability of Class A \nwarehouse space. At present, approximately 18.8 million square feet of Class A warehouse \ninventory is on the market, with average asking rents reaching $12.66 per square foot. This trend \nunderscores the continued strong demand for high-quality, modern industrial facilities.\n\u2012 The second quarter of 2025 was marked by the execution of some of the largest leases across the \nPhiladelphia region, spanning a diverse range of counties and industries\u2014including Logistics, \nMedical, Personal Care, and Manufacturing. This activity highlights the breadth and vitality of the \nlocal market. Among the most prominent transactions, Performance Team signed the region\u2019s \nlargest lease of the year, securing 1,200,000 square feet at 995 Taylors Lane. Additionally, Partners \nWarehouse committed to 351,000 square feet at 3195 Route 206, while Dentsply Sirona renewed its \nlease for 262,500 square feet, further strengthening the region\u2019s leasing momentum.\n\u2012 Industrial leasing activity in the second quarter rapidly increased to 5.2M square feet, the largest \namount of leasing activity seen since the third quarter of 2022. Among this elevated leasing activity, \nClass A product captured 52.6% of industrial leasing volume in the Greater Philadelphia region, \nbuoyed by some of the largest leases this quarter, such as Performance Team and Grocery Outlet.\n\u2012 Two significant projects broke ground this quarter, including the development of the Merck Building \nat 155 Innovation Boulevard in New Castle County for 470,000 square feet and 205 Schoolhouse \nRoad in Montgomery County for 176,000 square feet. The Merck Building is a built-to-suit \ndevelopment that will be fully occupied by Merck upon delivery, while 205 Schoolhouse Road is a \nspeculative development that is still fully available for lease.\n\u2012 Construction starts totaled 646,000 square feet in the second quarter, significantly lower than the \n8-quarter average, falling short of the benchmark by just under 1.8M square feet. This trend of \ndecreasing construction starts has been seen throughout the nation, as developers are exercising \ncaution due to rising construction costs, concerns over tariffs, and challenges in securing financing.\n\u2012 Industrial demand in Greater Philadelphia, measured by the total square footage tenants are \nsearching for in the market, represents approximately 7.6M square feet. Among this space, 26.6% \nof user demand is shown as growing their footprint, while 56.3% of user demand is new to the \nmarket. Substantial requirements that are both growing and new to the market are promising for the \nfuture of the Greater Philadelphia industrial market, as it projects increased leasing activity and \nabsorption in the coming quarters.  \nEconomy\nLeasing Market Fundamentals\nMajor Transactions\nOutlook\n\n\nNEWMARK\n2Q25\nEconomy\n\n\nNEWMARK\n5\nThe Greater Philadelphia economy saw a small increase in unemployment for the 12 months ending in May and has matched the US unemployment rate after falling below the national average \nover the past year. Nonfarm payroll employment increased by 1.3% in May, representing a slight rise from the moderate growth observed in the latter half of 2024.

This is approximately a 45.6% increase in \nconstruction deliveries compared to the first half of 2024. The 16 buildings that have delivered over the course of this year had little preleasing and boast a vacancy rate of 97.6%, thus increasing \nthis quarter\u2019s vacancy rate to 7.0%. This quarter experienced positive quarterly absorption of 1,210,733 square feet. The positive absorption was primarily driven by Performance Team\u2019s 1.2M SF \noccupancy in June at 995 Taylors Lane in Cinnaminson. Large leases signed in the region, such as Performance Team\u2019s, are an encouraging sign for the market.\nNew Construction Drives Vacancy Up Despite Positive Absorption\nHistorical Construction Deliveries, Net Absorption, and Vacancy\n7.0%\n0.0%\n2.0%\n4.0%\n6.0%\n8.0%\n10.0%\n12.0%\n14.0%\n-10.0\n-5.0\n0.0\n5.0\n10.0\n15.0\n20.0\n25.0\n2005\n2006\n2007\n2008\n2009\n2010\n2011\n2012\n2013\n2014\n2015\n2016\n2017\n2018\n2019\n2020\n2021\n2022\n2023\n2024\n2025\nYTD\nTotal Vacancy \nSF, Millions\nConstruction Deliveries (SF)\nNet Absorption (SF)\nTotal Vacancy (%)\nLong-Term Avg.

But the continued \neasing demand has resulted in more choices and benefits for users that have been subjected to a prolonged stretch of steep rent growth. \nVacancies in the United States have risen to 7.4%, a decade-long high, while deliveries continued to outpace tenant expansion.  Net absorption \nfell 8.1 million SF in the first half, including negative 5.9 million SF in the second quarter.  Demand in Canadian markets \u2013 particularly for logistics \nproperties \u2013 was 5.7 million SF in the red through June. Easing demand raised the vacancy rate to 4.2%, a 40-basis point increase from Q1.\nRent growth throughout Canada measured 1.3% in the second quarter, down from 7% a year ago and from an average of 8.6% since 2019. \nMeanwhile, overall rent growth in the U.S. year to date has fallen to 1.7% compared to 4.1% through the first half a year ago and an average of 7% \nin the last five years.  \nNevertheless, due to record rent gains during the Covid years, many leases still are renewing at higher rates after being marked to market. This is \nseen chiefly with smaller spaces in the U.S., where available inventories remain tight. \nNew leasing volume excluding renewals rose in most markets and soared more than 50% above prior two-year averages in markets in the Midwest \nand South, including Saint Louis, Richmond, Columbus, Nashville, Greenville, Memphis, Charlotte and Greensboro. San Francisco and California\u2019s \nInland Empire also saw improved volume.\nDespite rising 80 basis points through the first half, the vacancy rate for specialized and typically smaller spaces nationally is 4.2%. Some of the most \nacute shortages of small space are in Nashville, Jacksonville, Orlando, Tampa and Charlotte. \nThe inventory of logistics buildings of 100,000-500,000 SF has grown by 14% since 2021 and the vacancy rate for big-box space stands at 8.3%, \nthe highest since 2012. But tariffs present a risk for warehouse-and-distribution buildings, particularly in major West Coast port-dependent markets \nthat are seeing slowing imports. After 10 months of steady growth, container traffic through the Port of Long Beach in May was down 8.2% and off \n5% at the Port of Los Angeles.\nNearing the end of a record wave of new development, U.S. industrial building deliveries are moderating. New construction starts fell to just \n2.6 million SF in Q4, a record quarterly low. But as the construction pipeline thins, supply growth will likely outpace net absorption in upcoming \nquarters. Austin, Indianapolis, Greenville/Spartanburg, Phoenix and San Antonio stand out as markets with risks of prolonged elevated availability, \nparticularly with distribution buildings.\nIn Canada, working off the excess supply of new speculative warehouse space remains the central issue for the nation\u2019s industrial market.  The \nmost available space is the 15 million SF in the Toronto market.  There also is considerable new supply available in Calgary and Southern Ontario\u2019s \nGreater Golden Horseshoe as developers sought opportunities in these parts in recent years for their attractive land and development costs.\nINDUSTRIAL OVERVIEW\nLOWEST VACANCY RATE \nNE, Omaha\n2.6%\nBC, Vancouver\n4.0%\nOH, Cleveland\n4.0%\nMN, Minneapolis\n4.1%\nON, Toronto\n4.2%\nU.S. Index\n7.4%\nCanada

Net absorption has slowed sharply well below the 10-year average largely \ndue to major distribution center closures, while asking rents have dropped nearly \n30% amid abundant sublease space and widespread lease concessions. Although \ngrowth in imports and retail inventories has recently supported demand, upcoming \ntariffs and a projected slowdown in retail sales for 2025 threaten to reduce demand for \nlogistics space, especially in port-reliant areas. However, a steep drop in construction \nstarts signals limited future supply, potentially tightening the market and pushing rents \nhigher starting in 2026.\nMARKET INDICATORS\nQ2 2025\nQ1 2025\nQ4 2024\nQ3 2024\nQ2 2024\n\u25bc    12 Mo.

However, the submarket recorded -2.53 \nmillion SF of net absorption over the past 12 months, driven by continued tenant \nmove-outs and delayed backfills.

Meanwhile, construction volume slowed to 2.2 million \nSF, down from 3.3 million SF in Q1, which should help moderate further vacancy \nincreases.

Lease rates for industrial space have \ndecreased since 2023 due to lower demand and rising vacancy rates. The vacancy rate \njumped as well, from 5.1% (1Q25) to 6.0% (2Q25). The vacancy rate for 2Q25 does not \ninclude sublease availability, which could add another point or two. Average sale rates \ncontinue to be price-segmented based on numerous variables. Despite the data, LA/\nSouth Bay industrial real estate remains at a healthy vacancy rate that gives buyers and \ntenants more options to consider at pricing terms in their favor. This shift has not been \nseen in five years. Listing time on market has been closely tied to how agents guide \npricing for their clients based on submarket conditions.\nMARKET INDICATORS\nQ2 2025\nQ1 2025\nQ4 2024\nQ3 2024\nQ2 2024\n\u25bc    12 Mo.

Increased \nvacancies translate into improved market conditions for tenants with rents falling \nmore than 10% from their recent peak.  The reduced demand for industrial space \nreflects concerns about the impact of tariffs, which were blamed for declines in cargo \nthrough Los Angeles\u2019 port complex. Year-over-year container traffic in May through \nthe Port of Los Angeles was down 5% and off 8.2% at the Port of Long Beach. Vacancy \nrate growth is serving to bring the industrial market more into balance.

With 4.2 million SF absorbed over the past year, it trails faster-growing \nWest and Sun Belt markets. Yet its restrained supply pipeline-completions and projects \nunder construction both well below national averages-has preserved market balance. A \n5.9% vacancy rate, tighter than both local history and national norms, reflects this discipline. \nLogistics tenants drove 90% of leasing, buoyed by Chicago\u2019s intermodal superiority \nand cost-effective rents. Rent growth of 4.3% year-over-year eclipsed the national pace. \nWhile Chicago lags in raw absorption, its lean supply and resilient demand architecture \nposition it to withstand macroeconomic tremors with uncommon poise and equilibrium.\nMARKET INDICATORS\nQ2 2025\nQ1 2025\nQ4 2024\nQ3 2024\nQ2 2024\n\u25bc    12 Mo.

Due to limited new construction and little new \nvacancies, the actual vacancy rate decreased sharply. The market continues to maintain \na functional occupancy near 100%. Tenant demand remains strong with bidding wars \nhappening over quality properties as they become available. This is an opportunity for \nindustrial property owners to increase lease rates as long as this is the trend. Speculative \ndevelopment remains near non-existent with only a handful of spec buildings being \nerected since 2020.

Net \nabsorption was slightly positive, but demand stayed weak, particularly in flex and \nmanufacturing. Renewals-such as Tecomet\u2019s long-term deal at 301 Ballardvale \nSt., Wilmington-outpaced new leases. Landlords offered concessions while still \npushing rents. Vacancy rose to 8%, the highest since 2014, and leasing volume \ndeclined for the third year in a row. Activity in 2025 has been subdued. Some \nsigns of life remain: suburban renewals and new leases like Transaera at 22 \nKent Street in Somerville and Worldwide Perishables, Inc.\u2019s renewal at 5 5th St., \nWilmington.

More than 5 million square feet of new industrial product was delivered this quarter. \nAt the same time, projects under construction declined, and the vacancy rate held relatively \nsteady, leading to an indication that the market may be gradually moving toward a more \nbalanced state following the elevated construction levels of recent years.

Despite \nweaker tenant demand, average annual NNN rents increased to $14.47/SF, reflecting \nlandlord confidence or pricing discipline for newer assets. Sale prices declined \nto $224.45/SF from $233.00 in Q1, indicating recalibrated investor expectations. \nWhile macroeconomic uncertainty and rising vacancies persist, long-term industrial \nfundamentals remain strong. Overlaying this is a historic U.S. trade deficit contraction, \ndriven by falling imports and record exports. This shift complicates logistics but may benefit \nthe region\u2019s export-driven base and support industrial leasing in the year\u2019s second half. \nMARKET INDICATORS\nQ2 2025\nQ1 2025\nQ4 2024\nQ3 2024\nQ2 2024\n\u25bc    12 Mo.

But \nthe first positive United States trend since Covid hit a wall in the second quarter while revised Canadian net absorption totals turned negative after \nthree years of modest gains. \nU.S. net absorption was in the red 16.3 million SF in Q2, reversing 11.7 million SF of tenant expansion in the three previous quarters. The contraction \npushed up the vacancy rate 30 basis points to a record 14.2%. \nClass A tenants relinquished 6.9 million SF of space in the second quarter, pushing up the vacancy rate 40 basis points to 21.2%. Class B buildings \nposted 8.2 million SF of negative net absorption. The Q2 vacancy rate ticked up 20 points to 12.7%.\nThere had been recent signs that the recovery could have staying power as long as economic conditions remained positive. Absorption in Class A \nbuildings had been positive for only the second time since 2021 and older buildings, which had been steadily losing occupancy, saw absorption \nstabilized.  With attendance rising gradually and job growth slowing, a slow recovery and elevated vacancy rates looked likely. \nIn capital markets, the values for investment-grade buildings aimed at traditional office tenants have fallen by up to half. Since 2022, institutions and \nREITs have been net sellers, giving private buyers and owner-users opportunities to capitalize on discounts that often are below replacement costs. \nValues are likely to dip further as more liquidity leads to another round of price discovery. \nThe continued occupancy losses in the U.S. since early last year have been mitigated by growth in about half of the nation\u2019s top 50 office markets, \nincluding a surge in New York.  But the same trend has failed to materialize in other gateway cities, while many secondary markets are facing slow job \ngrowth and still are losing occupancy. Meanwhile, office-using job growth has nearly stalled.\nTypical requirements continue to trend toward smaller spaces, and many markets report that space consolidations are not yet over. The typical deal \nsize remains about 15% less than the average from 2015-2019.  \nFewer new buildings are appearing on the market. The 45 million SF delivered in 2024 were the least since 2012.  Forty-one million SF are projected \nfor this year. Eight of the last 10 quarters are among the lowest number of starts on record.  Despite the national trend of a shrinking pipeline, some \nmarkets face supply pressures. Austin leads major markets with 3% of its inventory under construction. Miami and Boston both have about 2.5% of \ninventory in the pipeline.\nIn Canada, there was 4.9 million SF of positive net absorption measured from 2022-2024. But the outsized negative adjustment to net absorption in Q1 \nof -5.2 million SF is due to an update to research methodology, specifically from the reclassification of listings as vacant until there is confirmation of \noccupancy. The revised measurement shows 509,000 SF of net tenant expansion in the second quarter for a net negative in the first half of 4.7 million \nSF.\n* Please note that the statistics represented in these

Downtown vacancy remained high at 12.2%, rising by \n50 basis points QoQ. The overall increase was partly due to the delivery of new office \nprojects across the region. Even as vacancy stays high, demand for premium office \nspace remains strong. A key example is Oxford Properties\u2019 full acquisition of four \ndowntown towers from CPP Investments: The Stack, Guinness Tower, Marine Building, \nand MNP Tower, which shows confidence in Vancouver\u2019s trophy assets.

The perception that Denver is back to \nnormal is misleading. While certain submarkets are showing signs of normalcy; Denver\u2019s \nlargest submarket, the CBD, continues to show minimal signs of improvement. While most \ncompanies have mandated return to the office nationally, the enforcement locally is lacking. \nThe City and County of Denver has yet to mandate a return-to-work policy, which unfortunately \nhas set the wrong tone for other companies in the CBD. When a large institutional owner/\ndeveloper recently sells a newly constructed Class A office building 90% leased for cost, that \ntells you what investors think of Denver.

Availability remains elevated at 19.3%-above the \n16.0% national rate-but is easing, especially in premier 4 & 5 Star assets. Leasing has \nrebounded, with 12-month volume reaching a post-2021 high, up over 10% from late \n2024. Meanwhile, Chicago leads a national reset, removing more office space than it adds \nfor a second year, shrinking total inventory by nearly 4% in two years. Though occupancy \ndeclined 4.3 million SF over the past year, sustained demolition and adaptive reuse are \nstabilizing fundamentals.

In Q1 2025, net absorption turned positive, aided by limited new supply \nand office-to-multifamily conversions. Office vacancy stands at 9.5%, outperforming \nthe national rate of 14.2%. However, leasing volume continues to slow, with new deals \ndown 24% in size and individual lease counts 13% below pre-pandemic levels. Activity \nis driven largely by smaller, client-facing tenants, especially in southern suburban areas \nlike Independence and Brecksville.

While vacancy continues to \nrise, the pace has slowed, and availability is declining, suggesting stabilization. Suburban \noffices outperform downtown due to cost and accessibility. Trade-related uncertainty \nand return-to-office inconsistencies pose renewed risks, particularly for sublets. Tenant \nincentives remain high, masking weak net effective rents, especially in premium buildings. \nDowntown Toronto faces a significant inventory glut, dampening recovery momentum. \nNonetheless, cautious optimism persists as occupier sentiment improves, even as \neconomic headwinds and tariff concerns temper confidence in a near-term rebound.\nTORONTO, ON\nMARKET INDICATORS\nQ2 2025\nQ1 2025\nQ4 2024\nQ3 2024\nQ2 2024\n\u25bc    12 Mo.

Uncertainty; downward pressure on office space needs; \nhigh costs of construction; and stagnant, elevated interest rates contributed to \nless construction starts and cautious strategies among tenants and investors. \nStubborn interest rates and rolling debt are leading to more properties hitting \nthe market and sales volumes increasing.\nPACIFIC NORTHWEST, WA\nMARKET INDICATORS\nQ2 2025\nQ1 2025\nQ4 2024\nQ3 2024\nQ2 2024\n\u25bc    12 Mo.

That follows a first-quarter 7,089,219-SF contraction. Annual net absorption has been \nfalling steadily since peaking at 70.8 million SF in 2021. There were 67 million SF absorbed in 2022, 43 million SF in 2023 and 22.2 million SF last year. \nIncluded in the current negative reading is a 24% increase from Q1 in the move-out rate to more than 108 million SF.  \nMove-outs, which include spaces subject to the bankruptcy process, averaged 84 million SF in the last three years. The jump is tied directly to space \noccupied by Big Lots, Conn\u2019s, Joann, Forever 21, Party City, Red Lobster, T.G.I. Fridays and other merchants and restauranteurs that began working \nthrough severe financial and legal woes in the last 18 months.\nDespite changing tastes and an upturn in brand-name tenants in distress, the nationwide market of 11.9 billion SF remains fundamentally tight in Q2 \nwith overall vacancy at 4.3%, close to the historic low. The vacancy rate was 2.7% for general retail, the largest category with 6.5 billion SF or 55% of \ntotal inventory.  Neighborhood centers totaled 2.9 billion SF for 24% of inventory and were at 6.3% vacancy. Strip and power centers totaled 1.5 billion \nSF and averaged just less than 5% vacancy. Malls totaled 876 million SF and were at 8.8% vacancy. \nTenants and brokers in the field continue to report healthy competition for quality space, resulting in available space backfilling at the fastest pace in \nnearly 15 years. \nIncreased competition for space also has been driven by the limited amount of new developments across the U.S. since 2010. From 2000 to 2009, \napproximately 300 million square feet of retail space were delivered annually, of which nearly 40% was available for lease. Much has changed. Only 81 \nmillion square feet of new retail space has been delivered annually since early 2020, with the vast majority comprising build-to-suit projects. This has \nleft fewer second-generation space options for tenants seeking to expand.\nStrong activity in the property sales market has occurred since last year. Retail investment sales gained momentum in 2024 with annual volume \nreaching $59 billion\u2014an 8% increase from the prior year. That momentum extended into 2025. First-quarter volume climbed 11% beyond the same \nperiod in 2024, and April\u2019s preliminary figures came in 45% higher than a year ago.\nThe overall Canadian retail market recovered from negative 1.7 million SF in the first quarter to close out the first half with 355,121 SF of positive net \nabsorption. The nation\u2019s retail property market is characterized by robust demand, limited supply and changing consumer preferences. The nation\u2019s \nsurging population growth has ensured that retail foot traffic remains active despite dampened consumer spending and murkier economic conditions. \n* Please note that the

Most \nnotably, the bankruptcy and subsequent nationwide closing of the Hudson\u2019s \nBay Company affected six major regional shopping malls as well as the flagship \ndowntown location now vacant as of mid-June. Conversely, two years since its \nclosure, the former Nordstrom space at CF Pacific Centre will be divided into \nfour future retail units. In the Fraser Valley, Finix Holdings purchased Cottonwood \nCentre at 45585 Luckakuck Way, a multi-property grocery anchored shopping \ncentre from joint-owners PCI Developments, Nicola Wealth, and Northland \nProperties for $115,000,000, or $450 per square foot.

Leasing activity remains healthy \nin key submarkets like Cherry Creek and RiNo, where national brands and experience-\ndriven retailers continue to seek space. However, elevated construction costs and broader \neconomic uncertainty have slowed some expansion plans and delayed deal flow.  Average \nasking rents held steady at $26.48 per square foot NNN, and construction activity remains \nminimal, with just 0.2% of inventory underway, most of it preleased.  Investment volume is \nrelatively muted, with private buyers continuing to dominate transactions under $5 million \nand cap rates inching higher. Denver\u2019s retail market remains resilient.

Yet structural \ntightness remains: availability has compressed to 5.8%-a near record low-especially \nin small spaces and grocery-anchored centers. Despite muted construction, with just \n760,000 SF underway (mostly pre-leased), Chicago remains among national leaders in \nmove-ins. The CBD is slowly recovering, narrowing its gap with suburban and urban \npeers. However, rent growth is softening; inflation-adjusted rates are declining, and \n1.8% nominal growth lags historic norms.

Vacancy and availability rates have steadily \ndeclined since early 2021, with central submarkets showing the most constrained \nconditions. New construction has lagged long-term trends, hindered by high \ndevelopment costs, further tightening supply. While rental growth trails the national \naverage, it is expected to remain ahead of inflation.

In the last six quarters 816,814 units have been leased up. New York and large markets in the South and Southwest, \nsuch as Dallas and Phoenix, have been growth leaders in the first half.\nThe Q2 decline in overall vacancy by 10 basis points to 8.1% is attributed to the higher quality Class A segment where demand has exceeded supply. \nThe solid rental demand through Q2 of 267,273 units follows the 548,911 units leased in 2024, the second most on record. Accelerated demand \nfor apartments has been supported by steady employment and economic growth. Furthermore, older members of Gen Z are entering the prime \napartment rental age, while more baby boomers are reaching an age where renting becomes a better option.\nAs apartment demand is growing at an above-average pace, the development cycle has peaked and is winding down. The annual inventory growth \nrate has fallen from 3.6% in 2024 to 1.3% through the first half, the lowest percentage since 2013. Net deliveries have declined for three consecutive \nquarters, falling nearly 30% to less than 130,000 units in the first quarter. Forecasts show that as few as 80,000 units are due for fourth-quarter delivery. \nConstruction starts have fallen to a decade-plus low due to the extended lease-up periods developers are experiencing, higher capital costs and \nstricter lending.\nCanada\u2019s first-half net absorption total is off 17% from a year ago. The easing demand is due, in part, to the government scaling back its permissive \nimmigration policies. Vacancy remains near multi-year lows. The Ottawa-Gatneau, Vancouver and Toronto markets continue to have the tightest \nconditions in the country.\nTo avoid added costs and bureaucracy connected with traditional multifamily, many developers opt to build for-sale condominiums versus dedicated \nrental units. High-rise condominiums are popular as rentals. The Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation estimates that as much as 50% of these \ncondos are sold to investors and then placed into the shadow rental market.\nAfter gaining momentum in the second half of last year on falling interest rates, Canada\u2019s economy is facing a recessionary climate because of the trade \nwar. While most Canadian goods sold to the U.S. are duty-free under the current United States-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, 35% tariffs for steel \nand aluminum, as well as for the non-U.S. portion of finished motor vehicles, are due to take effect August 1. Canada supplies 23% of the U.S.\u2019s steel \nand about 50% of aluminum. These tariffs could drive Canadian exports sharply lower this summer. Layoffs already have been announced by several \nautomakers.

Increased competition \nand supply side pressure may encourage more concessions from owners and \ndevelopers heading into the second half of the year.  \nSALE BY BUYER TYPE\nSALE BY SELLER TYPE\nTOP SELLERS (PAST 12 MONTHS)\nSALES VOLUME\nGeis Companies\n $56,760,000 \nDavid Cisan\n $9,500,000 \nPinellas Pines Apartments LLC\n $4,379,600 \nAnders & Carol Aase\n $3,250,000 \nRandy A & R Tracey Fulmer \n $2,635,000 \nNET ABSORPTION, NET DELIVERIES, & VACANCY\n**\u2019Sale by Buyer\u2019 and \u2018Sale by Seller\u2019 Data is comprised of data from the previous 12 months. \nTOP BUYERS (PAST 12 MONTHS)\nSALES VOLUME\nContinental Properties Company, Inc.\n $56,760,000 \nAffluent Realty of Florida\n $3,360,000 \nJoseph Rossi\n $3,250,000 \nGena Yousef\n $2,635,000 \nFrank & Mary Russo \n $2,635,000 \nMARKET INDICATORS\nQ2 2025\nQ1 2025\nQ4 2024\nQ3 2024\nQ2 2024\n\u25bc     12 Mo.

Rent growth has remained consistent, ranging between 2.5% and 3% over the \npast four quarters. Cincinnati ranks among the top 15 major U.S. markets for rent growth, \nunderscoring the region\u2019s sustained demand and resilience within the Midwest. The average \neffective monthly rent reached $1,315 in Q2 2025, marking a 2.73% year-over-year increase, \nlargely driven by strong demand in Northeast Cincinnati suburbs and Northern Kentucky. \nAs several developments approach completion, new construction starts are projected to \ndecline by 55% in 2025. Despite some recent volatility, Cincinnati is well-positioned for \ntightening market conditions in the coming years, supported by healthy population growth \nand a slowdown in the development pipeline.\nSALE BY BUYER TYPE\nSALE BY SELLER TYPE\nTOP SELLERS (PAST 12 MONTHS)\nSALES VOLUME\nVenture Real Estate Co.\n $13,700,000 \nMGI Communities\n $10,300,000 \nEveringham Properties\n $2,900,000 \nClermont Metropolitan Housing Authority\n $2,390,000 \nEric Krumpelman \n $2,375,000 \nNET ABSORPTION, NET DELIVERIES, & VACANCY\n**\u2019Sale by Buyer\u2019 and \u2018Sale by Seller\u2019 Data is comprised of data from the previous 12 months. \nTOP BUYERS (PAST 12 MONTHS)\nSALES VOLUME\nManor\n $13,700,000 \nPLK Communities\n $10,300,000 \nDWK Construction\n $2,900,000 \nAppelman Property Group\n $2,390,000 \nCopperwood Realty Group \n $2,375,000 \nMARKET INDICATORS\nQ2 2025\nQ1 2025\nQ4 2024\nQ3 2024\nQ2 2024\n\u25bc     12 Mo.

Rental growth has plateaued, constrained by wage \nstagnation, and vacancies are rising from historic lows. High interest rates have \nincreased rental demand but also hindered new development feasibility, slowing \nconstruction starts. Some condo developers are pivoting to rentals due to declining \nunit values and financing hurdles. Investor-owned units face refinancing risk, especially \nfrom properties purchased during low-rate periods. Demographic shifts further cloud \nthe outlook, as population growth is driven by newcomers with less stable rental \ndemand, while inter- and intra-provincial migration trends remain negative.\nSALE BY BUYER TYPE\nSALE BY SELLER TYPE\nTOP SELLERS (PAST 12 MONTHS)\nSALES VOLUME\nGreenrock\n $437,184,000 \nCanadian Apartment Properties REIT\n $278,011,000 \nOMERS\n $216,300,000 \nTimbercreek Capital, Inc.\n $160,823,249 \nPower Corporation of Canada\n $132,000,000 \nNET ABSORPTION, NET DELIVERIES, & VACANCY\n**\u2019Sale by Buyer\u2019 and \u2018Sale by Seller\u2019 Data is comprised of data from the previous 12 months. \nTOP BUYERS (PAST 12 MONTHS)\nSALES VOLUME\nBrookfield Corporation\n $437,184,000 \nStarlight Investments Ltd.\n $352,800,000 \nLankin Investments\n $239,261,000 \nAIMCo\n $160,823,249 \nEquiton, Inc.\n $130,199,999 \nMARKET INDICATORS\nQ2 2025\nQ1 2025\nQ4 2024\nQ3 2024\nQ2 2024\n\u25bc     12 Mo.

Lease renewals are not factored \ninto absorption unless the renewal includes the \noccupancy of additional space. (In that case, the \nadditional space would be counted in absorption.) \nPre-leasing of space in non-existing buildings (e.g., \nProposed, Under Construction, Under Renovation) \nis not counted in absorption until the actual move-in \ndate.\nCAP RATE\nThe income rate of return for a total property that \nreflects the relationship between one year\u2019s net \noperating income expectancy and the total price \nor value. Calculated by dividing the net operating \nincome by the sale price or value.\nCLASS A OFFICE\nIn general, a class A building is an extremely \ndesirable investment-grade property with the highest \nquality construction and workmanship, materials \nand systems, significant architectural features, the \nhighest quality/expensive finish and trim, abundant \namenities, first rate maintenance and management; \nusually occupied by prestigious tenants with above \naverage rental rates and in an excellent location \nwith exceptional accessibility. They are most eagerly \nsought by international and national investors willing \nto pay a premium for quality and are often designed \nby \narchitects \nwhose \nnames \nare \nimmediately \nrecognizable. A building meeting this criteria is \noften considered to be a landmark, either historical, \narchitectural or both. It may have been built within the \nlast 5-10 years, but if it is older, it has been renovated \nto maintain its status and provide it many amenities. \nBuildings of this stature can be one-of-a-kind with \nunique shape and floor plans, notable architectural \ndesign, excellent and possibly outstanding location \nand a definite market presence.\nCLASS B OFFICE\nIn general, a class B building offers more utilitarian \nspace without special attractions. It will typically \nhave ordinary architectural design and structural \nfeatures, with average interior finish, systems, and \nfloor plans, adequate systems and overall condition. \nIt will typically not have the abundant amenities \nand location that a class A building will have. This \nis generally considered to be more of a speculative \ninvestment. The maintenance, management and \ntenants are average to good, although, Class B \nbuildings are less appealing to tenants and may be \ndeficient in a number of respects including floor \nplans, condition and facilities. They therefore attract \na wide range of users with average rents. They lack \nprestige and must depend chiefly on lower price to \nattract tenants and investors. Typical investors are \nsome national but mostly local.\nCLASS C OFFICE\nIn general, a class C building is a no-frills, older \nbuilding that offers basic space. The property has \nbelow-average maintenance and management, a \nmixed or low tenant prestige, and inferior elevators \nand mechanical/electrical systems. As with Class B \nbuildings, they lack prestige and must depend chiefly \non lower price to attract tenants and investors.\nGROSS ABSORPTION\nFor existing buildings, the measure of total square \nfeet occupied (indicated as a Move-In) over a given \nperiod of time with no consideration for space vacated \nduring the same time period. Sublet space and lease \nrenewals are not factored into gross absorption. \nHowever, in a lease renewal that includes the leasing \nof additional space, that additional space is counted \nin gross absorption. Preleasing of space in non-\nexisting buildings (Planned, Under Construction or \nUnder Renovation) is not counted in gross absorption \nuntil actual move in, which by definition may not be \nany earlier than the delivery date.\nSource: CoStar Group and NAIOP Research Foundation\nLEE & ASSOCIATES RESEARCH\n\n\nGLOSSARY OF TERMS\nINDUSTRIAL GROSS RENT\nA type of Modified Gross lease where the tenant pays \none or more of the expenses in addition to the rent. \nExact details must be confirmed for each lease.\nINVENTORY\nExisting inventory refers to the total square footage \nof buildings that have received a certificate of \noccupancy and are able to be occupied by tenants. \nIt does not include space that is either planned, or \nunder construction.\nMODIFIED GROSS\nModified Gross is a general type of lease rate where \ntypically the tenant will be responsible for their \nproportional share of one or more of the expenses. \nThe Lessor (landlord) will pay the remaining expenses. \nFor example: Plus Electric means the tenant pays rent \nplus their own electric expense, or Plus Janitorial \nmeans the tenant pays the rent plus their own janitorial \nexpense. Both of these are types of Modified Gross \nLeases, which may vary from tenant to tenant.\nNET ABSORPTION\nFor existing buildings, the measure of total square \nfeet occupied (indicated as a Move-In) less the total \nspace vacated (indicated as a Move-Out) over a given \nperiod of time. Lease renewals are not factored into net \nabsorption. However, in a lease renewal that includes \nthe leasing of additional space, that additional space \nis counted in net absorption. Pre-leasing of space in \nnon-existing buildings (Planned, Under Construction \nor Under Renovation) is not counted in net absorption \nuntil actual move in, which by definition may not be \nany earlier than the delivery date.\nTRIPLE NET (NNN)\nA lease in which the tenant is responsible for \nall expenses associated with their proportional \nshare of occupancy of the building.\nUNDER CONSTRUCTION\nBuildings in a state of construction, up until they \nreceive their certificate of occupancy. In order for \nCoStar to consider a building Under Construction, \nthe site must have a concrete foundation in place.\nVACANCY RATE\nExpressed as a percentage - it identifies the amount \nof New/Relet/Sublet space vacant divided by the \nexisting RBA. Can be used for buildings or markets.\nSource: CoStar Group and NAIOP Research Foundation\nLEASE TYPE\nRESPONSIBILITY FOR EXPENSES\nOTHER\nGross (full service)\nLandlord pays all or most of the\noperating expenses and taxes.\nCosts of operation must be disclosed \nin lease.\nModified Gross\nExpenses are divided between\ntenant and landlord.\nCosts can be double or triple net\ndepending on terms of lease.\nNet\nTenant pays all operating\nexpenses.\nLandlord must disclose tenant\nresponsibility in lease.\nTriple Net\n(Net-net-net, or NNN)\nTenant pays all operating\nexpenses, taxes and insurance.\nLandlord is responsible for structure, \nroof and maybe parking lot.\nCOMMON LEASE TYPES MATRIX\nLEE & ASSOCIATES RESEARCH\n\n\nThe information and details contained herein have been obtained from third-party sources believed to be reliable, however, Lee & Associates has not \nindependently verified its accuracy.

      "Q1 2025 \nLOCAL EXPERTISE. INTERNATIONAL REACH. WORLD CLASS.\nSUBURBAN PHILADELPHIA, PA\nINDUSTRIAL MARKET OVERVIEW\nANDREW MAYER, Research Analyst\nThe Eastern Pennsylvania industrial market experienced a relatively slow start in Q1 2025 as \nit began its recovery following a challenging period. The 12-month net absorption for the \nquarter showed a decline compared to the last four quarters, with overall absorption for \nthe year also falling short of 2024 levels. Additionally, vacancy rates have risen by 40 basis \npoints, indicating a slight softening in the market. Construction activity has decreased, as \nover 11 million SF of space were delivered in the past two quarters, contributing to a growing \nsupply of available industrial space. This influx of new inventory and increasing vacancies \nhas led to a slight reduction in average asking rates for triple-net (NNN) leases. Despite these \nchallenges, the market is expected to find equilibrium moving into the next quarter, which \ncould create more opportunities for transactions as we progress through the fiscal year.\nMARKET INDICATORS\nQ1 2025\nQ4 2024\nQ3 2024\nQ2 2024\nQ1 2024\n\u25bc    12 Mo.

Moreover, the sagging United States and Canadian markets could \nsuffer disruption as they react to the U.S.\u2019s controversial new trade and tariff regime.\nU.S. net absorption in the first quarter totaled 9.5 million SF and only 129.4 million SF of growth in 2024 \u2013 the least since the great recession in 2010. \nYear-over-year rent growth has decelerated significantly over the past 12 months to 2.1%, which is less than half the five-year average before Covid. \nAcross Canada \u2013 after 79 million SF of growth in 2023 and 2024 for the largest ever two-year gain \u2013 tenants shed 8.9 million SF of space in the first \nquarter, the most on record. Nearly 5.5 million SF of the negative net absorption total was logistics space.\nConstruction across North America is slowing.  In the U.S., quarterly net supply additions are on pace to fall below the pre-pandemic three-year \naverage by midyear and continue declining through 2026 when supply growth is set to hit an 11-year low.  In Canada, new construction starts fell \nto just 2.6 million SF in Q4, the lowest level on record.\nWhile new deliveries have peaked, several Sunbelt and Midwest markets with fewer development constraints are still posting a record supply of \nnew space that could take more than two years to absorb.  Austin, Indianapolis, Phoenix, Greenville/Spartanburg and San Antonio stand out as \nmarkets with risks of prolonged elevated availabilities, particularly among logistics buildings from 100,000 SF to 500,000 SF.\nConsumer spending eased in the first two months of 2025 while the launching of multiple trade wars simultaneously occurred. This risks derailing \nthe key drivers of logistics leasing, including U.S. imports and inventories, which could cause true net absorption to underperform this year.\nThe stock of logistics properties 100,000 SF and larger has grown 20% in the last four years.  The vacancy rate among these buildings has surpassed \n9%, the most since 2012. The small-space market remains a bright spot. Occupancy in buildings smaller than 50,000 SF has fallen about 0.3% in the \nlast 12 months.  But because of chronically low levels of development of product in this range, the sub 4% vacancy rate is near pre-Covid record \nlevels. Some of the most acute shortages of small space can be found in Nashville, Jacksonville, Orlando, Tampa and Charlotte.\nSignificant tariffs will force retailers to raise prices while increasing the likelihood that retailers will be hesitant to expand distribution networks until \nthe threat of additional trade barriers dissipates.  \nProperty sales totaled more than $65 billion in 2024, a 10% increase from the year before. Deal volume also gained momentum with 11,766 \ntransactions, a 6% gain, which underscored a broader recovery in activity beyond just rising asset values. Institutional buyers stepped up \nacquisitions in the fourth quarter, particularly in deals greater than $50 million. While REITs remained net buyers, their activity was comparatively \nmuted. Meanwhile, private equity firms returned to the market in the third quarter after nearly two years on the sidelines.\nINDUSTRIAL OVERVIEW\nLOWEST VACANCY RATE \nNE, Omaha\n2.8%\nBC,

Leasing numbers and absorption figures were consistent \nwith previous quarters. The lack of large transactions is concerning, and the inventory \nof large available (75K+) units, is turning this into a Tenant\u2019s market.

As a result, vacancy \nhas climbed to 7.8%, the highest since 2014, driven by slowing demand for large block \nwarehouse space and uncertainty around tariffs. Flex space, vital for Boston\u2019s biotech \nsector, has also seen weaker demand, contributing to 1.2M SF of negative absorption \nover the past year. More supply is set to deliver this year, likely pushing vacancy near 8.0% \nby mid to late 2025. Rent growth has slowed to 5.7%. Rent growth is a trailing indicator \nand thus will likely continue this slowing trend absent a rebound in tenant demand. Long-\nterm, vacancy is forecast to peak in 2025 before returning to positive net absorption.\nMARKET INDICATORS\nQ1 2025\nQ4 2024\nQ3 2024\nQ2 2024\nQ1 2024\n\u25bc     12 Mo.

The 12-month net absorption for the \nquarter showed a decline compared to the last four quarters, with overall absorption for \nthe year also falling short of 2024 levels. Additionally, vacancy rates have risen by 40 basis \npoints, indicating a slight softening in the market. Construction activity has decreased, as \nover 11 million SF of space were delivered in the past two quarters, contributing to a growing \nsupply of available industrial space. This influx of new inventory and increasing vacancies \nhas led to a slight reduction in average asking rates for triple-net (NNN) leases. Despite these \nchallenges, the market is expected to find equilibrium moving into the next quarter, which \ncould create more opportunities for transactions as we progress through the fiscal year.\nMARKET INDICATORS\nQ1 2025\nQ4 2024\nQ3 2024\nQ2 2024\nQ1 2024\n\u25bc    12 Mo.

It was a dramatic turnaround from the 26.8 million SF loss of net absorption in Q1 a year ago.\nConversely, Canada, which posted 5.5 million SF of positive absorption in 2024 \u2013 its healthiest year since 2018 \u2013 opened the year with a massive \ncontraction of 5.2 million SF of negative net absorption.  The Q1 reversal is a greater reduction in net absorption than the 5.7 million SF loss for 2021 \nand follows a gain of nearly 2.3 million SF a year ago.\nMuch of the recent gain in the U.S. has come in New York City where users are scrambling for space to accommodate an uptick in attendance. \nNationally, however, supply additions have kept the vacancy rate near a record high. While here are some signs the recovery could broaden throughout \n2025, demand remains anemic in most major markets. \nTenant behavior in the post-Covid environment has become nuanced.  Of the leases signed in 2024, the deals averaged 15% to 20% less space. \nSmaller users tend to upgrade their spaces while larger tenants tend to stay in place.\nThe supply pipeline is diminishing rapidly. The 67.1 million SF underway is the least since 2012.  Vacancy is expected to continue to climb through 2026 \nand rents growth should continue to decelerate prior to settling into a period of paltry growth of about 1% though next year.\nAsking rents have remained flat for the last four years. At a $36-per-SF average, rents are about $1 per SF more than rents entering 2020 \u2013 poor \nperformance when consumer prices have risen 25%in the same period. Rents at five-star buildings, currently averaging $48 per SF, still are slightly \nlower than in early 2020. \nSupply growth slowed to a decade-low pace in 2024, a taste of things to come as the amount of new inventory slated to some to market in the rest of \nthe decade drops massively.   Less than 45 million SF in new deliveries completed in 2024, the least since 2012 and far less than the 10-year average \nof about 780 million SF.\nThe pipeline also is qualitatively different.  About 13% is medical office and 17% targeted top biotech users.  Another 38% is being built for owner-\nusers.  Less than a third is comprised of traditional for-lease office buildings, compared to nearly two-thirds of space completed in the last 25 years.  The \nthaw in the U.S. office market has accelerated, unveiling a sector previously sidelined by investors.  Transaction volumes, which regained momentum \nthroughout 2024 and surged notably in the fourth quarter, continued their improving trend in the first quarter of 2025, recently finishing 31% higher \nyear-over-year. This follows a 22% increase in total sales for 2024 compared to the cyclical lows of 2023.\n* Please note that the statistics represented in these tables are based on CoStar defined market territories

This improvement comes on the heels \nof a challenging 2024, recorded as the worst year ever for the local office sector. The \nlatest figures suggest a turning point, as businesses gradually reassess their office space \nneeds, contributing to renewed leasing activity and occupancy stabilization. While \nuncertainties remain, the early momentum in 2025 indicates that Phoenix\u2019s office market \nis on a path toward recovery, positioning itself for a more balanced and sustainable \ntrajectory in the months ahead.

Both owners and tenants \nseem to take a much-needed pause after an always hectic end of the year.  Leasing \nactivity remained anemic during the quarter, and the few larger transactions were state \nagencies. Deed-in-lieu foreclosures and vastly discounted sales trickled over to start \nthe year. There are clearly two tales of ownership; stable and strengthening assets that \ncan still fetch a premium versus struggling and financially stressed assets that meet \nthe requirements above. On a positive note, the outcry from both downtown tenants \nand landlords has prompted the city to address the persistent crime, vagrancy and \nproperty damage that has plagued downtown for the last several years.\nDENVER, CO\nMARKET INDICATORS\nQ1 2025\nQ4 2024\nQ3 2024\nQ2 2024\nQ1 2024\n\u25bc    12 Mo.

Despite what would typically \nindicate an undersupplied market, changing national office usage trends have \nkept vacancy rates steady. Most new construction is build-to-suit, contributing \nlittle to overall vacancy. While pricing has seen slight upward pressure due to \nnew and renewing space, vacancy has not significantly shifted.

This \nstability since mid-2021 stems from little new construction, positive absorption. \nOur CBD\u2019s 10.7% vacancy ranks third lowest nationally. Reduced inventory of B/C \nproperties (via apartment & hotel conversions) contributes to sub-9% vacancy in \nthat segment. Relocations and consolidations drive leasing, with significant sublease \nopportunities available. Despite slowing to 1.4%, rent growth exceeds national \naverages, particularly in suburban areas. Construction remains at historic lows and \nis mostly in mixed-use projects. 180,000 sf is now underway, in Kenwood, Midtown \nand North Kentucky.

For the first time in four quarters, the market saw \nsignificant positive 12-month net absorption, and overall absorption for the year \nexceeded 1 million square feet. While this could fluctuate in the coming quarters, it \nmarks a notable rebound for the office sector. However, the largest transactions of \nthe quarter painted a different picture, as many were tied to redevelopment plans or \npotential property conversions. These trends signal an evolving landscape, and it will \nbe intriguing to see how these projects unfold.

Looking over the past decade, both \nabsorption and net deliveries have varied. Vacancy rates have trended upward locally and \nnationwide, largely influenced by the rise of remote work.

Nevertheless, vacancies remain at and near record lows.\nUnited States\u2019 retailers shuttered 7,089,219 SF of space in the first quarter, which follows the net absorption of 23.1 million SF in 2024, of one of the \nweakest annual totals in a decade.  Despite the sharp upturn in retailer bankruptcies and store closures, availability across U.S. retail space markets \nremains within 10 basis points of the historic low of 4.8% as new development is constrained.  Deliveries for the five years prior to Covid was twice the \ntotal five years since the lockdown. In total, just 19 million square feet of retail space delivered since 2020 is available for lease across the U.S.\nIn Canada, negative net absorption totaled 1,767,468 SF in the first quarter, a turnaround from the 1.6 million SF of tenant growth in Q1 last year. \nEvery retail category \u2013 malls, power centers, neighborhood centers, strip centers and general retail \u2013 was negative in the first quarter. In addition to \nstore closings, retail store efficiency \u2013 measured by sales as a percentage of occupied floor space \u2013 is no longer outperforming the U.S.  Nationwide, \nthe vacancy rate is 1.8%.\nIt was a confluence of factors driving retail bankruptcies and store closures. After years of below-average closures the combination of rapidly rising \ncosts, a challenging capital markets environment and significant competition from value and e-commerce retail forced certain retailers like Walgreens, \nFamily Dollar and Advance Auto to close underperforming locations.  It also pushed other large occupiers like Big Lots, Party City and Conn\u2019s into \nbankruptcy.\nThe uptick in merchant failures also can be traced back to persistently low home sales, reducing the sales of furnishings, appliances, etc.  Five of 12 \nretailers to shutter in 2024 operated in housing-dependent categories.  But despite the increase in closures, an overwhelming majority of tenants \ncontinue to report a lack of quality available space and available space is backfilling at the fastest pace in nearly 15 years.\nThe reason for the current historically tight conditions has been the limited volume of new retail space delivered in recent years.  In the five years prior \nto the lockdown the annual average of newly completed space was 71 million SF compared to 32 million SF since 2020.\nRetail sales, excluding e-commerce, gasoline and autos, have surged more than 30% on a nominal basis since the end of 2019. While inflationary \npressures contributed to this growth, adjusted retail sales remain more than 10% greater than prior to the pandemic. In total, the amount of retail space \noccupied across the U.S. has increased by less than 2% since the end of 2019. \nWith the costs of development rising much faster than rents for the past 15 years, the economics of new retail development are exceedingly difficult \nto pencil in many locations. The net result is a market facing a significant shortage of available first-generation space at a time when dozens of large \nnational tenants are looking to expand.\n* Please note that the statistics

Overall vacancy \ndeclined to 8.1%, snapping a 13-quarter rise. Large markets in the South and Southwest were the growth leaders.\nCanada\u2019s national multifamily market continues to be extremely tight. Vacancy is still sitting near multi-year lows with the most unaffordable markets of \nVancouver and Toronto continuing to have the tightest conditions in the country. The nationwide vacancy rate is 2.9%.\nThe strong Q1 performance in the U.S., an increase of 61% over the same period a year ago, is a continuation of a growth rebound that began last year \nwhen 556,286 units were absorbed, the most in three years.  Absorption was driven by stable economic growth plus a continued slowing of tenants \nmaking the jump to home ownership and creating fewer units to backfill.\nThe surge in U. S. tenant growth follows the biggest construction boom in decades, saturating the market with 1,270,222 new units over the last two \nyears, equal to 6.3% of the total inventory. The 673,7687 units delivered in 2024 were the most in any year on record. While supply has outpaced \ndemand over the past 12 quarters, the gap has closed significantly. This strong demand reflects continued release of pent-up household formations, \nespecially in the mid-priced point properties. \nWhile demand for apartments is growing at an above-average pace, the development cycle has peaked and is poised to wind down quickly over the \nupcoming year. Net deliveries have already declined for three consecutive quarters, falling nearly 30% to 123,000 units in the first quarter of 2025. \nFewer apartments will reach completion as the year progresses, with the forecast falling below 70,000 units by the fourth quarter based on a thinning \nconstruction pipeline. Construction starts have fallen to a decade-plus low due to extended lease-up periods developers are experiencing, higher \ncapital costs, and stricter lending.\nWhile vacancies have surged in the South and Southwest due to oversupply, most Midwest and Northeast markets have seen only moderate supply \nincreases, leading to more balanced fundamentals and favorable rent growth in those regions. In contrast, rents have fallen in markets across states \nin the South, Arizona, and Texas. Vacancy is highest in Austin and San Antonio among the 50 largest markets, with Austin\u2019s reaching over 15% in 2024 \nand Class A vacancies exceeding 17%.\nHowever, vacancies in the Texas markets peaked in recent quarters, following Jacksonville, Raleigh and Atlanta in the first half of 2024. Vacancies in 30 \nof the top 50 markets declined in the first quarter as supply growth fell below still-strong absorption. Miami, Minneapolis, Inland Empire and San Jose \nled vacancy rate declines, each falling at least 50 basis points. As in 2024, Dallas led unit absorption in the first quarter, followed by Phoenix, which \njumped up two spots in ranking.

Apartment supply is limited, with large complexes near Downtown \nand smaller communities dispersed across the metro. Despite adding 340 units \nin the past year and 320 more under construction, demand remains modest. Net \nabsorption totaled just 200 units, due in part to increased affordable housing \noptions. Vacancy rose slightly in 2024 but remains below the 4.9% national \naverage. Rent growth slowed to 1.3% in 2023, reflecting a return to Bakersfield\u2019s \nslow-growth, low-vacancy norm.\nSALE BY BUYER TYPE\nSALE BY SELLER TYPE\nTOP SELLERS (PAST 12 MONTHS)\nSALES VOLUME\nRiverland Homes, Inc.\n $56,633,500 \nJeremy Willer Construction, Inc.\n $12,075,000 \nLaurel Smith\n $11,125,000 \nRobert E Smith\n $11,000,000 \nDavid Azouz \n $5,680,000 \nNET ABSORPTION, NET DELIVERIES, & VACANCY\n**\u2019Sale by Buyer\u2019 and \u2018Sale by Seller\u2019 Data is comprised of data from the previous 12 months. \nTOP BUYERS (PAST 12 MONTHS)\nSALES VOLUME\nThe Bascom Group\n $56,633,500 \nBaldeep Singh Sidhu\n $12,075,000 \nEmamuel Krontiz\n $11,125,000 \nGraceada Partners\n $11,000,000 \nJeff Liu \n $5,680,000 \nMARKET INDICATORS\nQ1 2025\nQ4 2024\nQ3 2024\nQ2 2024\nQ1 2024\n\u25bc     12 Mo.

Supply has modestly outpaced demand, with 630 new units \ndelivered and 840 absorbed. However, older construction properties saw \nnegative absorption as renters shifted to newer, affordable options. No new \nconstruction has started since late 2021 due to high costs and soft rent growth, \nwhich slowed to 1.7% year over year.

Year-\nto-date, renter demand is stronger compared to last year. Economic softness, \nincluding job losses in entertainment and tech, and ongoing outmigration \ncontinue to pressure the market. However, demand varies by asset quality, with \nhigher-income renters driving activity, particularly for top-tier units. Despite \nchallenges, the market benefits from a measured completion schedule, with \nvacancy rates improving from 5.10% in Q4 2024 to 4.94% in Q1 2025.

The \nvacancy rate climbed to 13.2% in the first quarter of 2025. Absorption over the \npast 12 months has been modest as lease up time for stabilization varied. One \nof the newest and largest completions of the year was Ascent at Metropolitan \nNaples, a 270-unit community by the joint venture of The Dolben Company, GFI \nDevelopment, and SFH Development. Rent growth decelerated -3.8%, ending Q1 \nat an average asking rent of $2,311/unit. As the market takes time to absorb new \nunits, we expect apartment demand to remain steady.

Continued \nimprovement across most metrics confirms that investors, both private and institutional, \nsee South Florida\u2019s multifamily properties as essential within their portfolios. With the \nuncertainty surrounding November\u2019s presidential election resolved, and interest rates slowly \ntrending downward, there is further reason for optimism. Still, the tariffs and potential trade \nwar that are roiling the broader equities markets around the world are worth monitoring. \nWhile stock market trouble and global market uncertainty could impact buying power and \nreal estate investment demand, it could also create a flight to safety for investors seeking \ntangible, domestic assets. Either way, the South Florida market and economy remain \nstrong, and we hope the resilience and momentum here continues throughout 2025.\nSALE BY BUYER TYPE\nSALE BY SELLER TYPE\nTOP SELLERS (PAST 12 MONTHS)\nSALES VOLUME\nStarwood Capital Group\n $381,538,297 \nMorgan Stanley & Co.

Lease renewals are not factored \ninto absorption unless the renewal includes the \noccupancy of additional space. (In that case, the \nadditional space would be counted in absorption.) \nPre-leasing of space in non-existing buildings (e.g., \nProposed, Under Construction, Under Renovation) \nis not counted in absorption until the actual move-in \ndate.\nCAP RATE\nThe income rate of return for a total property that \nreflects the relationship between one year\u2019s net \noperating income expectancy and the total price \nor value. Calculated by dividing the net operating \nincome by the sale price or value.\nCLASS A OFFICE\nIn general, a class A building is an extremely \ndesirable investment-grade property with the highest \nquality construction and workmanship, materials \nand systems, significant architectural features, the \nhighest quality/expensive finish and trim, abundant \namenities, first rate maintenance and management; \nusually occupied by prestigious tenants with above \naverage rental rates and in an excellent location \nwith exceptional accessibility. They are most eagerly \nsought by international and national investors willing \nto pay a premium for quality and are often designed \nby \narchitects \nwhose \nnames \nare \nimmediately \nrecognizable. A building meeting this criteria is \noften considered to be a landmark, either historical, \narchitectural or both. It may have been built within the \nlast 5-10 years, but if it is older, it has been renovated \nto maintain its status and provide it many amenities. \nBuildings of this stature can be one-of-a-kind with \nunique shape and floor plans, notable architectural \ndesign, excellent and possibly outstanding location \nand a definite market presence.\nCLASS B OFFICE\nIn general, a class B building offers more utilitarian \nspace without special attractions. It will typically \nhave ordinary architectural design and structural \nfeatures, with average interior finish, systems, and \nfloor plans, adequate systems and overall condition. \nIt will typically not have the abundant amenities \nand location that a class A building will have. This \nis generally considered to be more of a speculative \ninvestment. The maintenance, management and \ntenants are average to good, although, Class B \nbuildings are less appealing to tenants and may be \ndeficient in a number of respects including floor \nplans, condition and facilities. They therefore attract \na wide range of users with average rents. They lack \nprestige and must depend chiefly on lower price to \nattract tenants and investors. Typical investors are \nsome national but mostly local.\nCLASS C OFFICE\nIn general, a class C building is a no-frills, older \nbuilding that offers basic space. The property has \nbelow-average maintenance and management, a \nmixed or low tenant prestige, and inferior elevators \nand mechanical/electrical systems. As with Class B \nbuildings, they lack prestige and must depend chiefly \non lower price to attract tenants and investors.\nGROSS ABSORPTION\nFor existing buildings, the measure of total square \nfeet occupied (indicated as a Move-In) over a given \nperiod of time with no consideration for space vacated \nduring the same time period. Sublet space and lease \nrenewals are not factored into gross absorption. \nHowever, in a lease renewal that includes the leasing \nof additional space, that additional space is counted \nin gross absorption. Preleasing of space in non-\nexisting buildings (Planned, Under Construction or \nUnder Renovation) is not counted in gross absorption \nuntil actual move in, which by definition may not be \nany earlier than the delivery date.\nSource: CoStar Group and NAIOP Research Foundation\nLEE & ASSOCIATES RESEARCH\n\n\nGLOSSARY OF TERMS\nINDUSTRIAL GROSS RENT\nA type of Modified Gross lease where the tenant pays \none or more of the expenses in addition to the rent. \nExact details must be confirmed for each lease.\nINVENTORY\nExisting inventory refers to the total square footage \nof buildings that have received a certificate of \noccupancy and are able to be occupied by tenants. \nIt does not include space that is either planned, or \nunder construction.\nMODIFIED GROSS\nModified Gross is a general type of lease rate where \ntypically the tenant will be responsible for their \nproportional share of one or more of the expenses. \nThe Lessor (landlord) will pay the remaining expenses. \nFor example: Plus Electric means the tenant pays rent \nplus their own electric expense, or Plus Janitorial \nmeans the tenant pays the rent plus their own janitorial \nexpense. Both of these are types of Modified Gross \nLeases, which may vary from tenant to tenant.\nNET ABSORPTION\nFor existing buildings, the measure of total square \nfeet occupied (indicated as a Move-In) less the total \nspace vacated (indicated as a Move-Out) over a given \nperiod of time. Lease renewals are not factored into net \nabsorption. However, in a lease renewal that includes \nthe leasing of additional space, that additional space \nis counted in net absorption. Pre-leasing of space in \nnon-existing buildings (Planned, Under Construction \nor Under Renovation) is not counted in net absorption \nuntil actual move in, which by definition may not be \nany earlier than the delivery date.\nTRIPLE NET (NNN)\nA lease in which the tenant is responsible for \nall expenses associated with their proportional \nshare of occupancy of the building.\nUNDER CONSTRUCTION\nBuildings in a state of construction, up until they \nreceive their certificate of occupancy. In order for \nCoStar to consider a building Under Construction, \nthe site must have a concrete foundation in place.\nVACANCY RATE\nExpressed as a percentage - it identifies the amount \nof New/Relet/Sublet space vacant divided by the \nexisting RBA. Can be used for buildings or markets.\nSource: CoStar Group and NAIOP Research Foundation\nLEASE TYPE\nRESPONSIBILITY FOR EXPENSES\nOTHER\nGross (full service)\nLandlord pays all or most of the\noperating expenses and taxes.\nCosts of operation must be disclosed \nin lease.\nModified Gross\nExpenses are divided between\ntenant and landlord.\nCosts can be double or triple net\ndepending on terms of lease.\nNet\nTenant pays all operating\nexpenses.\nLandlord must disclose tenant\nresponsibility in lease.\nTriple Net\n(Net-net-net, or NNN)\nTenant pays all operating\nexpenses, taxes and insurance.\nLandlord is responsible for structure, \nroof and maybe parking lot.\nCOMMON LEASE TYPES MATRIX\nLEE & ASSOCIATES RESEARCH\n\n\nThe information and details contained herein have been obtained from third-party sources believed to be reliable, however, Lee & Associates has not \nindependently verified its accuracy.

Several factors were behind the slowdown. Business owners paused expansions in 2023 largely due to lingering supply-chain issues \nand higher interest rates that reduced home sales and purchases of home improvement materials and appliances. In the U.S., a potential \nlongshoremen strike threatened East Coast shipping and caution continued to hobble growth plans in 2024 pending the general election \nand its effect on tariffs.\nFourth-quarter net absorption in the U.S. totaled 37 million SF, down 45% from the same period in 2023. For the year, net absorption totaled \n113.7 million SF, off 36% from 2023.  As long as net absorption can remain marginally positive, vacancy increases will likely slow in 2025 as \nthe volume of speculative developments completing construction is set to abate. The continued reduction in industrial construction starts that \noccurred in late 2024 also raises the probability that the U.S. vacancy rate could begin to decline by late 2025 or early 2026.\nIn the meantime, year-over-year rent growth has slowed to 2.1%, the slowest level since 2012. Thanks to record rent growth during the \npandemic, many leases are still renewing at more than 40% higher rates after being marked to market.  However, this is much more easily \nachieved in the small building segment of the market, where vacancy remains less than 4% and near pre-Covid record lows.  In contrast, the \nstock of logistics properties 100,000 SF or larger has grown by 20% over the past four years and the vacancy rate among these buildings has \nsurpassed 9%, hitting the highest level since 2012.\nAbundant distribution center closures by third party logistics firms contributed to the soft quarter with UNIS, DHL and Pitney Bowes each \nclosing more than one large facility in the final months of the year. Retailers and manufacturers selling goods such as furniture and building \nmaterials also continue to be negatively impacted by higher mortgage rates. During the fourth quarter, Big Lots closed a 3.9-million-SF facility \nin Columbus serving as its corporate headquarters and largest distribution center. Malouf, a luxury mattress maker, closed a 1.2 million SF \nfacility in Bakersfield and Home Depot vacated a 990,000 SF distribution facility that it listed for sublease in Chicago\u2019s Joliet submarket.\nWhile new deliveries have peaked, several Sunbelt and Midwest markets with fewer constraints on new development are still in the midst of \na record supply wave that could take tenants more than two years to fully absorb. Austin, Indianapolis, Greenville/Spartanburg, Phoenix and \nSan Antonio stand out as markets with risks of prolonged higher availability rates, particularly among larger industrial properties as developers \nhave been focused on building projects 50,000 SF or larger in recent years.\nArguably, the biggest issue for Canada\u2019s industrial market is the excess of recently developed speculative big-box spaces. Available sublet \nspace in properties with higher clear heights has reached the highest levels on record since 2013. Unsurprisingly, much of this available space \nis concentrated in the country\u2019s major distribution markets, including the Greater Toronto Area and Calgary.\nINDUSTRIAL OVERVIEW\nLOWEST VACANCY

Vacancy rates \nslightly increased to 4.5%, up from 4.3% in Q3, but remain relatively low compared \nto historical standards. The average NNN asking rate remained stable at $1.21 PSF, \nreflecting little change in rental pricing. Approximately 800,543 SF of industrial space \nis under construction, contributing to a steady inventory of 77.7 million SF.

A bright spot was the sales activity in \nthe quarter, $500M, ending the year off with $1.5B in sales, despite the high interest \nrates. This is higher than the previous two years. With limited construction deliveries \nanticipated in 2025, we predict the vacancy rate will stabilize, or lower slightly. With \nonly 3 new buildings over 500,000 SF available, large tenants will be faced with limited \noptions, and Landlords should benefit. While Colorado is still a highly desirable \nlocation, its population growth has slowed. This will have a lagging effect on Industrial, \nand we predict we won\u2019t feel the effects of this in the market for several years.\nMARKET INDICATORS\nQ4 2024\nQ3 2024\nQ2 2024\nQ1 2024\nQ4 2023\n\u25bc     Net Absorption SF\n279,744 \n2,707,000 \n 203,220 \n 1,178,728 \n 1,760,652 \n\u25b2     Vacancy Rate\n7.8% \n7.5% \n8.40%\n7.50%\n7.90%\n\u25bc     Avg NNN Asking Rate PSF\n$12.27 \n$12.31 \n$11.06 \n $11.01 \n $10.88 \n\u25bc     Sale Price PSF\n$171 \n$177 \n$177 \n$172 \n$172 \n\u25b2     Cap Rate\n7.4% \n7.2% \n7.2% \n7.2% \n7.1% \n\u25bc     Under Construction SF\n3,591,189 \n4,401,097 \n 4,633,930 \n 6,432,450 \n 8,450,390 \n\u25b2     Inventory SF\n287,911,539 \n286,712,209 \n 285,822,100 \n 283,503,041 \n 281,444,197 \nNET ABSORPTION, NET DELIVERIES, & VACANCY\nUNDER CONSTRUCTION\nTOP LEASE TRANSACTIONS BY SF\nSIZE\nLANDLORD\nTENANT\nTENANT INDUSTRY\n11075 W. 112th\nBroomfield, CO\n 133,638 SF\nSuncap\nElectrosteel\nConstruction Supply\n4735 Florence Street, Bldg.

However, the re-entry of third-party \nlogistics providers signals a resurgence in future demand. Buildings with clear heights \nover 35 feet remain highly sought after, sustaining positive net absorption since 2020. \nPandemic-driven speculative developments have slightly increased vacancies as \nprojects are completed, though rates remain below 3%, outperforming the national \naverage.

On the sales side, fully leased properties \ncontinued to attract buyers, though rising cap rates have put downward pressure on \nvaluations. While average pricing per square foot has increased over 38% since 2020 \nto $104/SF, appreciation has started to plateau. A significant milestone was reached \nin Q4 2024 as the Charleston MSA surpassed 100 million square feet of industrial \nspace. Year-over-year, the amount of properties under construction has declined \nsharply.

Despite the slight slowdown in \nactivity, vacancy dropped to 3.64%, it\u2019s lowest level since Q1 2024. Absorption was limited \nto approximately 600,000 SF as a result of limited supply.

However, this increase \nwas less than in 2022-2023, when 11 million square feet of inventory caused \nvacancy to jump from 5.8% to 12.6%. This moderation reflects stronger \ndemand and improving fundamentals despite ongoing supply growth. \nAsking rents softened in some submarkets, with rising concessions, though \nsales prices continued climbing. Construction remains active, with 6.3 \nmillion square feet underway. Key leases from Saronic Technologies and \nFour Hands highlight continued activity.

Net absorption recorded a negative figure of -2,287,759 square feet, \nreflecting sustained challenges in tenant demand. The vacancy rate saw a \nslight increase to 8%, up from 7.8% in Q3 2024. However, average annual NNN \nasking rates remain strong at $14.36 per square foot, suggesting landlords are \nmaintaining pricing power despite headwinds. These trends highlight a dynamic \nmarket where vacancy increases, and declining absorption are partially offset by \nstable rental rates. This signals a need for cautious optimism as the market adapts \nto shifting economic conditions.\nMARKET INDICATORS\nQ4 2024\nQ3 2024\nQ2 2024\nQ1 2024\nQ4 2023\n\u25b2    12 Mo.

While construction starts are up in 2024, demand for new \nindustrial space still outpaces supply, maintaining a tight market.

Tenant demand in the United States closed 2024 by posting a second straight quarter of growth. Canada\u2019s absorption for the year was the \nmost since 2018. \nU.S. net absorption was 3.5 million SF in Q4 and totaled 11.2 million SF for the second half with premium Class A space most in demand. Nearly half \nthe nation\u2019s top 50 office markets have seen positive demand since 2024 Q2, led by New York City. Some secondary and most tertiary markets have \nalso seen resurgent demand. But there are several gateway cities and many secondary markets that continue to lose occupancy to slow job growth and \nreduced space requirements post-Covid.\nNearly 23 million SF of negative absorption in the first quarter of 2024 brought the cumulative loss since the onset of Covid-19 to 206 million SF. By \ncomparison, absorption losses associated with the Great Recession of 2008-09 totaled about 50 million SF. \nA number of companies have increased worker attendance requirements or plan to do so, including Disney, Starbucks, X and Amazon, whose CEO, \nAndy Jassy, said: \u201cWhen we look back over the last five years, we believe the advantages of being together in the office are significant.\u201d Even Zoom \nhas called its workers into the office for two days a week. JP Morgan is discussing possibly bringing back its approximately 300,000 employees to the \noffice daily in 2025. \nThe construction pipeline output is diminishing with less than 50 million SF delivered in 2024, the least since 2014 and about 20 million SF less than \naverage for the last 10 years. Even this reduced new supply is likely to outpace tepid demand. The overall vacancy rate is expected to climb beyond its \ncurrent 13.9% before peaking next year.\nThe makeup of product in the pipeline is also different from recent history. Nearly a quarter is being built for owner occupiers. Almost a fifth targets \nbiotech lab users and about 10% is medical office. Only half is comprised of traditional, for-lease office buildings, compared to almost two thirds of \nthe space completed in the past 25 years.\nWhile there are signs that the volume of sales transactions has hit bottom, financing is among the remaining challenges. Meanwhile, nearly $28 billion \nin CMBS loan maturities are scheduled to come due in 2025. After dropping in the second quarter, delinquency rates are now back up to 8.6% and \ncould hit double digits next year. Lenders have been allowing borrowers some forbearance, but the clock is ticking to correct operational deficiencies. \nMeanwhile, investors naturally are finding a raft of opportunities in this sector.\nIn Canada, net absorption of 5.5 million SF in 2024 was led by Calgary\u2019s 2.1 million SF of tenant growth and 1.9 million SF of net absorption in Toronto. \nDeliveries are poised to drop off significantly in coming quarters, with only 11 million SF underway in Q4. This is off significantly from the 22-million-SF \npeak in 2021.\n* Please note that the statistics represented in these tables are based on CoStar defined market territories and may not all represent

Director\nThe Phoenix office market, like much of the broader U.S. office sector, continues \nto grapple with challenges stemming from shifts to in-office, hybrid, and remote \nwork models. In 2024, the market faced its most difficult year on record, with a \nnegative net absorption of 2 million square feet and direct vacancy rates hovering \naround 24%. The third quarter alone saw a negative net absorption of 90,417 \nsquare feet, capping off a historically challenging year. Looking ahead, Metro \nPhoenix is poised to rely on its business-friendly policies, strategic location, and \naffordable cost of living as key drivers to stabilize and rejuvenate its office market. \nMETRO PHOENIX, AZ\nMARKET INDICATORS\nQ4 2024\nQ3 2024\nQ2 2024\nQ1 2024\nQ4 2023\n\u25b2     12 Mo.

An exceptional example is  Connor Clark & Lunn \nFinancial Group who has secured 82,000 SF at 1090  West Pender. Recent sublease \nactivity has transformed the availability  dynamics within the 10,000 SF range. While \nsublease activity once  comprised up to 15% of all leasing activity has since jumped up \nto 20%  prompting landlords to compete for prospective tenants by offering turn-key \nopportunities. Looking ahead, improving economic conditions coupled with  the tail \nend of the current construction cycle may see a healthy levelling of  the market. \nVANCOUVER, BC\nMARKET INDICATORS\nQ4 2024\nQ3 2024\nQ2 2024\nQ1 2024\nQ4 2023\n\u25b2     12 Mo.

Class A suburban properties outperformed downtown assets, while rental \nrates remained stable at $28-$32 per square foot (gross). Sublease availability \nexceeded 2.5 million square feet, pressuring landlords to offer concessions like \ntenant improvements and free rent. Leasing activity focused on smaller, high-quality \nspaces as occupiers optimized footprints. New development is limited to build-to-\nsuit projects, while investment activity remains sluggish due to rising interest rates. \nTenants continue to find favorable negotiating conditions heading into 2025.\nTWIN CITIES, MN\nMARKET INDICATORS\nQ4 2024\nQ3 2024\nQ2 2024\nQ1 2024\nQ4 2023\n\u25bc    12 Mo.

This has been mostly due to the lack of, or moderation of, new inventory. While \nthe population has risen substantially for the past number of years, the supply of new \noffice space has been relatively non-existent. This has kept the effect of diminishing \nneeds for office space to a minimum. The relative rates have remained fairly consistent, \nand are still positioned as a \u201cvalue\u201d compared with geographic alternatives close in \nCalifornia. Since this market has been stable, I expect rates to begin to rise a bit as the \ncosts to \u201cretain\u201d tenants, the costs to refurbish existing spaces, and general beginnings \nof a \u201cback to workplace\u201d mentality, sets in and pushes pricing.\nRENO, NV\nMARKET INDICATORS\nQ4 2024\nQ3 2024\nQ2 2024\nQ1 2024\nQ4 2023\n\u25b2    12 Mo.

Vacancy rates remained at or near \nrecord lows, and despite a new round of tenant bankruptcies and store closures, the lack of quality space is crimping some tenants\u2019 expansion plans.\nNet absorption totaled 23 million SF in 2023 in the U.S., a decline from the last three years of strong tenant growth in which demand exceeded new \nsupply by nearly 60% and rents gained 10.4%. \nCanada posted 5.5 million SF of net absorption in 2024, the most since 2022. The healthy tenant expansion came despite a dearth of available space. \nThe vacancy rate has ticked down from 3% in 2017 to a record low 1.4% in 2024. \nAdditionally, after more than three years of healthy demand, many available spaces skew to the lower end of the quality spectrum. Thus, tenants \nseeking newer, higher-quality space in affluent locations are finding few available options.  About 6.5 million SF were absorbed in Q4, the retail sector\u2019s \n16th straight quarter of positive demand primarily being driven by tenants in the food services, off-price, experiential and healthcare sectors.\nU.S. retail property fundamentals remain historically tight in 24Q3, as a lack of new deliveries and steady demand formation have kept the space \navailable for lease at a record low of just 4.7%. Against the backdrop of the scarcity of available retail space, intense competition among tenants vying \nfor prime locations is now playing out across the U.S.  Developers continue to be challenged to make new ground-up retail development deals pencil \nat today\u2019s costs at current rent levels. This environment should support further rent gains for landlords and allow supply-constrained conditions to \npersist for the foreseeable future. \nWhile store closures weigh on the current level of net absorption, they also provide needed supply for growth-minded tenants. Market participants \nreport exceptionally strong backfill demand for spaces as they go dark, with some locations able to secure rent increases of 40% or more. Leasing \nactivity remains concentrated in smaller spaces of under 2,500 SF, where activity is being overwhelmingly driven by growth from quick-service \nrestaurants and personal services. Tenants such as Starbucks, Crumbl Cookies, Yum Brands, and Restaurant Brands International, owner of BK, Tim \nHortons, Popeyes and Firehouse Subs, all have signed up for dozens of new locations over the past year. \nPropelled by record spending on outside-of-the-home food purchases, retail tenants in the food and beverage sector accounted for nearly 20% of all \nleasing activity over the past year.  From a geographic perspective, the most significant uptick in demand for retail space has been seen in Sun Belt \nmarkets that are experiencing substantial population and buying power growth. Seven of the top 10 markets leading the way in inventory-adjusted \ndemand growth over the past year were in the Sun Belt, including four of the top five: Austin, Orlando, Miami and Phoenix. \nThe other three markets in the top 10 for inventory-adjusted demand growth over the past year were all in the Midwest with Indianapolis, St. Louis and \nMinneapolis, each seeing absorption of at least 1.5 million SF over that time.  \n* Please note that the statistics represented in these tables are based on CoStar defined market territories and may not all represent the geographic area the label

We are in a historically \ntight market, with prime retail space non-existent on the open market. In \nfact, Omaha is among the tightest Midwest markets. Many factors have \ncontributed to this: resilient consumers, lack of new retail development \nleading to minimal tenant-move outs and increased rental rates. Rental rate \ngrowth in Omaha outpaces the national average by over 3%, and we sit \natall-time low under-construction stock.

Since 2016, the GTA\u2019s retail inventory has \nincreased by 4%. When compared to the 17% surge in population, this underscores a clear \nsupply-demand gap. Concerns about the rise of e-commerce previously slowed retail \nconstruction. However, with e-commerce usage steadying at 6%, demand for physical \nstores remains strong, driven by growing consumer spending.

Absorption was \ndriven by stable economic growth plus a continued slowing of tenants making the jump to home ownership and creating fewer units to backfill.\nMeanwhile, Canada\u2019s vacancy rate is 2.5%. Canadians dissatisfied with continued tight housing markets have forced government officials to scale back \nthe nation\u2019s immigration targets, beginning with a 20% cut in 2025.\nThe surge in U. S. tenant growth follows the biggest construction boom in decades, saturating the market with 1,270,222 new units over the last two \nyears, equal to 6.3% of the total inventory. The 673,7687 units delivered in 2024 were the most in any year on record. While supply has outpaced \ndemand over the past 12 quarters, the gap has closed significantly. This strong demand reflects continued release of pent-up household formations, \nespecially in the mid-priced point properties. \nSince the first quarter of 2022, overall rent growth has slowed significantly from 9.9% to just 1.1% for the third quarter. The Class A segment exhibited \nthe weakest performance, at 0.4%, a slight improvement from the negative or zero year-over-year rent growth experienced over the past year.  On the \nother hand, more balanced conditions in the middle of the market have resulted in Class B rent growth at 1.6%, outperforming the luxury price point \nand the national average. While projections for the remainder of 2024 indicate rent growth holding near 1%, there should be an acceleration by the \nsecond quarter of 2025. \nThe Sun Belt markets no longer exhibit the strongest rent growth with many previously fast-growing markets reporting significant deceleration. Metros \nwith the most robust rent growth were Washington, D.C., Richmond, Detroit, Cleveland and Louisville.  In contrast, former rent growth leaders Austin \nand Raleigh have experienced the steepest rent declines over the past four quarters, -4.7% and -2.9% respectively. It is a departure from the mid-teen \ngrowth rate each market enjoyed at the end of 2021.  Currently, the Midwest and Northeast lead the nation in rent growth, a trend expected to continue \ninto 2025. These markets have avoided the sharp reversal seen in Sun Belt locations, mainly due to their more modest construction pipelines during \nthe pandemic.  Deliveries in the Midwest in 2024 were 20,000 units more than in 2019, compared to a 120,000-unit increase in the Sun Belt. This \nrestrained gain in added supply should keep Midwestern markets more balanced, thereby avoiding the oversupply that leads to weaker rent growth.\nCanada\u2019s national multifamily market continues to be extremely tight because of reduced homebuying due to higher mortgage rates, scarcity of supply \nand rapid population growth. The vacancy rate is sitting near multi-year lows with the least affordable markets of Vancouver and Toronto as the nation\u2019s \ntightest. Calgary\u2019s market has tightened significantly since 2022.\nCanada\u2019s record-setting population growth has been a major fundamental factor driving multifamily demand. In 2023 the population rose by more \nthan a million persons, posting the highest growth rate since 1957.

The \nvacancy rate held steady at 5.10%, while asking rents rose slightly to $2,295 per unit, \nhighlighting rental market resilience. Although 21,022 units are in the construction \npipeline, development activity has slowed. The region benefits from a stable job \nmarket, but rising interest rates and inflation have tempered investor confidence. \nDespite these challenges, Los Angeles remains attractive to renters and investors due \nto its diverse economy and desirable living conditions. The market outlook remains \npositive, supported by demand and ongoing construction.\nSALE BY BUYER TYPE\nSALE BY SELLER TYPE\nTOP SELLERS (PAST 12 MONTHS)\nSALES VOLUME\nDLJ Real Estate Capital Partners\n $190,981,376 \nCIM Group\n $186,000,000 \nGreystar Real Estate Partners\n $126,018,750 \nFranklin Templeton\n $122,100,000 \nGemdale \n $110,250,000 \nNET ABSORPTION, NET DELIVERIES, & VACANCY\n**\u2019Sale by Buyer\u2019 and \u2018Sale by Seller\u2019 Data is comprised of data from the previous 12 months. \nTOP BUYERS (PAST 12 MONTHS)\nSALES VOLUME\nFPA Multifamily \n $463,081,376 \nPrime Administration\n $177,100,000 \nCityview\n $143,115,000 \nGoldstein Planting Investments\n $92,500,000 \nAdvanced Management Co \n $84,392,289 \nMARKET INDICATORS\nQ4 2024\nQ3 2024\nQ2 2024\nQ1 2024\nQ4 2023\n\u25b2     12 Mo.

While this marks a recovery, activity remains \n40% below the last cycle\u2019s average. Cap rates range from 4.3% to 5.6%, with \ncentral and coastal properties trading at the lower end. Institutional buyers, \ndriven by demand from life sciences, tech, and defense sectors, have accounted \nfor over 25% of acquisitions. These industries have spurred job growth and \nhousing demand, especially near key employment hubs. However, an increase in \nnew units in 2024 has led to a slight decrease in rents. Despite this, high interest \nrates and regulatory hurdles continue to affect investor confidence.\nSALE BY BUYER TYPE\nSALE BY SELLER TYPE\nTOP SELLERS (PAST 12 MONTHS)\nSALES VOLUME\nMG Properties\n $359,000,000 \nThe Premiere Residential Communities\n $342,800,000 \nJPMorgan Chase & Co.\n $300,500,000 \nCrow Holdings\n $283,000,469 \nLennar \n $246,473,078 \nNET ABSORPTION, NET DELIVERIES, & VACANCY\n**\u2019Sale by Buyer\u2019 and \u2018Sale by Seller\u2019 Data is comprised of data from the previous 12 months. \nTOP BUYERS (PAST 12 MONTHS)\nSALES VOLUME\nMarcus & Millichap\n $522,300,000 \nBlackRock, Inc.\n $283,000,469 \nKohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.

We use quotes because multifamily \nhas outperformed pretty much all asset classes in Florida, and geographically, South \nFlorida has ranked among the strongest performing markets nationwide for a number \nof years now, 2024 included. To that end, vacancy rates and cap rates ticked down \nquarter over quarter, and net absorption increased, which bodes well as we head into \n2025. With November\u2019s election uncertainty resolved, and interest rates slowly trending \ndownward, there is reason for optimism. Rental rates and sales numbers grew on a \nper door basis, so positive trends were pervasive throughout the sector\u2019s key metrics.\nSALE BY BUYER TYPE\nSALE BY SELLER TYPE\nTOP SELLERS (PAST 12 MONTHS)\nSALES VOLUME\nStarwood Capital Group\n $381,538,297 \nMorgan Stanley & Co.

Even though we have good demand, our inventory has \noutpaced that demand, resulting in continued competition for renters. This has \naffected both prices, and concessions in the area. The good news is that the \n\u201cunder construction\u201d portion of the market has substantially slowed, and I believe \nthat the over supply should diminish substantially in the coming year. This should \nstabilize the market, but may result in a reluctance to develop among owners.\nSALE BY BUYER TYPE\nSALE BY SELLER TYPE\nTOP SELLERS (PAST 12 MONTHS)\nSALES VOLUME\nBenedict Canyon Equities, Inc.\n$93,700,000 \nQuarry Capital\n$43,000,000 \nChris Vargas\n$16,700,000 \nGBS Advisors, Inc.\n$11,760,000 \nKennedy-Wilson Properties Ltd.\n$7,467,500 \nNET ABSORPTION, NET DELIVERIES, & VACANCY\n**\u2019Sale by Buyer\u2019 and \u2018Sale by Seller\u2019 Data is comprised of data from the previous 12 months. \nTOP BUYERS (PAST 12 MONTHS)\nSALES VOLUME\nMG Properties\n$93,700,000 \nTower 16 Capital Partners\n$43,000,000 \nVillage Investment Partners\n$11,760,000 \nGBS Advisors, Inc.\n$7,467,500 \nSt Gartlan Francis E. & Lucy F.

The \nmarket is balancing supply and demand, with  mid-priced 3-Star units experiencing \nstrong absorption. Demand has been  particularly strong in Northern Kentucky and \nsuburban areas such as North  Cincinnati. Rent growth remained stable at around \n3% vs.1% nationally,  with notable increases in high-demand areas like Northwest \nCincinnati.  However, construction activity is expected to slow significantly in 2025 \ndue  to high interest rates and vacancy, which could lead to tightening market \nconditions in the future.

Lease renewals are not factored \ninto absorption unless the renewal includes the \noccupancy of additional space. (In that case, the \nadditional space would be counted in absorption.) \nPre-leasing of space in non-existing buildings (e.g., \nProposed, Under Construction, Under Renovation) \nis not counted in absorption until the actual move-in \ndate.\nCAP RATE\nThe income rate of return for a total property that \nreflects the relationship between one year\u2019s net \noperating income expectancy and the total price \nor value. Calculated by dividing the net operating \nincome by the sale price or value.\nCLASS A OFFICE\nIn general, a class A building is an extremely \ndesirable investment-grade property with the highest \nquality construction and workmanship, materials \nand systems, significant architectural features, the \nhighest quality/expensive finish and trim, abundant \namenities, first rate maintenance and management; \nusually occupied by prestigious tenants with above \naverage rental rates and in an excellent location \nwith exceptional accessibility. They are most eagerly \nsought by international and national investors willing \nto pay a premium for quality and are often designed \nby \narchitects \nwhose \nnames \nare \nimmediately \nrecognizable. A building meeting this criteria is \noften considered to be a landmark, either historical, \narchitectural or both. It may have been built within the \nlast 5-10 years, but if it is older, it has been renovated \nto maintain its status and provide it many amenities. \nBuildings of this stature can be one-of-a-kind with \nunique shape and floor plans, notable architectural \ndesign, excellent and possibly outstanding location \nand a definite market presence.\nCLASS B OFFICE\nIn general, a class B building offers more utilitarian \nspace without special attractions. It will typically \nhave ordinary architectural design and structural \nfeatures, with average interior finish, systems, and \nfloor plans, adequate systems and overall condition. \nIt will typically not have the abundant amenities \nand location that a class A building will have. This \nis generally considered to be more of a speculative \ninvestment. The maintenance, management and \ntenants are average to good, although, Class B \nbuildings are less appealing to tenants and may be \ndeficient in a number of respects including floor \nplans, condition and facilities. They therefore attract \na wide range of users with average rents. They lack \nprestige and must depend chiefly on lower price to \nattract tenants and investors. Typical investors are \nsome national but mostly local.\nCLASS C OFFICE\nIn general, a class C building is a no-frills, older \nbuilding that offers basic space. The property has \nbelow-average maintenance and management, a \nmixed or low tenant prestige, and inferior elevators \nand mechanical/electrical systems. As with Class B \nbuildings, they lack prestige and must depend chiefly \non lower price to attract tenants and investors.\nGROSS ABSORPTION\nFor existing buildings, the measure of total square \nfeet occupied (indicated as a Move-In) over a given \nperiod of time with no consideration for space vacated \nduring the same time period. Sublet space and lease \nrenewals are not factored into gross absorption. \nHowever, in a lease renewal that includes the leasing \nof additional space, that additional space is counted \nin gross absorption. Preleasing of space in non-\nexisting buildings (Planned, Under Construction or \nUnder Renovation) is not counted in gross absorption \nuntil actual move in, which by definition may not be \nany earlier than the delivery date.\nSource: CoStar Group and NAIOP Research Foundation\nLEE & ASSOCIATES RESEARCH\n\n\nGLOSSARY OF TERMS\nINDUSTRIAL GROSS RENT\nA type of Modified Gross lease where the tenant pays \none or more of the expenses in addition to the rent. \nExact details must be confirmed for each lease.\nINVENTORY\nExisting inventory refers to the total square footage \nof buildings that have received a certificate of \noccupancy and are able to be occupied by tenants. \nIt does not include space that is either planned, or \nunder construction.\nMODIFIED GROSS\nModified Gross is a general type of lease rate where \ntypically the tenant will be responsible for their \nproportional share of one or more of the expenses. \nThe Lessor (landlord) will pay the remaining expenses. \nFor example: Plus Electric means the tenant pays rent \nplus their own electric expense, or Plus Janitorial \nmeans the tenant pays the rent plus their own janitorial \nexpense. Both of these are types of Modified Gross \nLeases, which may vary from tenant to tenant.\nNET ABSORPTION\nFor existing buildings, the measure of total square \nfeet occupied (indicated as a Move-In) less the total \nspace vacated (indicated as a Move-Out) over a given \nperiod of time. Lease renewals are not factored into net \nabsorption. However, in a lease renewal that includes \nthe leasing of additional space, that additional space \nis counted in net absorption. Pre-leasing of space in \nnon-existing buildings (Planned, Under Construction \nor Under Renovation) is not counted in net absorption \nuntil actual move in, which by definition may not be \nany earlier than the delivery date.\nTRIPLE NET (NNN)\nA lease in which the tenant is responsible for \nall expenses associated with their proportional \nshare of occupancy of the building.\nUNDER CONSTRUCTION\nBuildings in a state of construction, up until they \nreceive their certificate of occupancy. In order for \nCoStar to consider a building Under Construction, \nthe site must have a concrete foundation in place.\nVACANCY RATE\nExpressed as a percentage - it identifies the amount \nof New/Relet/Sublet space vacant divided by the \nexisting RBA.

      "INDUSTRIAL OUTLOOK\nPENNSYLVANIA MARKET | 2ND QUARTER 2025\n\n\nSECOND QUARTER | 2025\n\u00a9 2025, MacKenzie Commercial Real Estate Services, LLC | 2\nConstruction industry momentum has slowed in recent months due to high interest rates, economic uncertainty, and rising material costs. Nonresidential construction spending has \ndipped slightly, with private sector activity trailing behind public projects. While data center construction remains a bright spot, most other segments\u2014including manufacturing\u2014\nhave struggled, despite manufacturing spending still being significantly higher than five years ago. The residential sector has been hit hardest, with spending projected to fall \n11% in 2025 and homebuilder sentiment at its lowest since 2012 (excluding the pandemic\u2019s early impact). High mortgage rates have discouraged buyers and led builders to \nscale back. Unless interest rates decline, especially as tariffs continue to raise material prices, a rebound in construction activity remains unlikely.\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s dual mandate\u2014to maximize employment and maintain 2% inflation\u2014is \ntypically managed by adjusting interest rates, raising them to curb inflation or lowering them \nto spur job growth. While this strategy worked in 2022 and 2023 to slow both inflation and \nhiring, the Fed now faces the growing risk of stagflation, where inflation and unemployment \nrise simultaneously, making it difficult to address one goal without worsening the other. Inflation \nexpectations have surged, fueled by unpredictable tariff policies, while labor market strength \nis increasingly concentrated in sectors like healthcare and education, with sluggish hiring and \nquits indicating broader weakness. New entrants to the workforce, especially recent graduates, \nare struggling to find jobs, and with economic uncertainty elevated\u2014thanks to over 55 tariff \nadjustments and unclear immigration impacts\u2014the Fed chose to hold rates steady in June, taking \na cautious approach despite pressure from the White House.\n \nSouth Central Pennsylvania has added jobs at a slightly faster than average pace over the past \nyear, although growth has been a little slower in the York area, and unemployment remains low \nacross the region, with rates ranging from 2.6% in Chester County to 3.4% in York County. \nConstruction activity has held up decently well across the region, especially in the Harrisburg \nMSA where industry wide employment is up 3.2% year over year. \nECONOMICS & CONSTRUCTION\nCAPITAL INDICATORS*\nPA INDUSTRIAL MARKET\n12-Month Volume\nTotal Square Feet\nAverage Price PSF\nAverage Cap Rate\nProperties Sold\nVolume vs. Prior Year\n$2,997,403,753\n28,297,008\n$104/sf\n6.6%\n227\n7.1%\nUnder Construction\nProposed Projects\nSNAPSHOT\n2Q25\nECONOMIC FACTORS\nCONSUMER PRICE INDEX\nUNEMPLOYMENT RATE\nAVERAGE CAP RATE\nMANUFACTURING \nJOB GROWTH\nMARKET SIZE\nX\nCIVILIAN LABOR FORCE\n1,542,707,904 SF\n6,539,900\n4.0%\n2.7%\n6.6%\n- .4%\n*Indicators taken from MSCI Real Capital Analytics for a rolling 12-month period based on reported industrial sales for the State of Pennsylvania.

This decline\nwas likely driven by increasing macroeconomic uncertainty caused\nby unclear tariff policies and persistently high interest rates. The\nauthors expect that heightened uncertainty will likely persist at\nleast through the rest of the year and lead to reduced leasing\nactivity. Given this continued uncertainty and persistently high\ninterest rates, the current NAIOP Industrial Space Demand\nForecast projects that net absorption will be nearly flat over\nthe second half of 2025 (2.8 million square feet).\n\n\nDemand for industrial space is expected to recover somewhat after\noccupiers have time to adjust to a new tariff regime. However,\nhigher tariffs and slowing employment growth will likely result in\nslower demand growth than that experienced from 2020 to 2022 or\nin the six years that preceded the pandemic. Absorption is expected\nto rebound beginning in the second quarter of 2026, with full-year\nabsorption totaling 119.3 million square feet. Another 109.7 million\nsquare feet of absorption is expected in the first half of 2027 (see\nFigure 1 for quarterly projections).\nThe Industrial Market\nThe health of the U.S. industrial market is now heavily influenced\nby macroeconomic conditions and U.S. trade policy, which could\nalter the competitive strategies of occupiers that import raw,\nintermediate and finished goods, as well as those that export\nproducts abroad. Large and frequent shifts in expected tariff rates\nhave made it difficult for these occupiers to make long-term leasing\ndecisions. Since earlier fears of an escalating trade conflict have\nlargely abated following recent negotiations, it is possible some\noccupiers that had deferred leasing decisions will choose to move\nforward in the second half of the year. However, it remains a near\ncertainty that overall tariff rates will remain higher for the\nforeseeable future. Many industrial space users will need to adapt to\nthis reality when planning their current and future occupancy\nneeds.\nIn the near term, the market for industrial space will likely continue\nto soften as new supply outstrips demand. According to CoStar,\n194.6 million square feet of new space was delivered in the first\nhalf of the year, contributing to a 50-basis-point increase in the\nvacancy rate, to 6.7%. Roughly 466 million square feet of industrial\nspace is currently under construction, down sharply from the billion\nsquare feet under construction at the end of 2022 and close to the\nsize of the project pipeline in mid-2019. Vacancy rates may\ncontinue to rise for several more quarters until demand growth\ncatches up with new deliveries. Until then, rental rates are likely to\nremain flat or even decline in some markets.\n\n\nEconomic Trends\nAttempts by importers to get ahead of the expected tariff\nannouncement in April produced some large swings in gross\ndomestic product (GDP) in the first and second quarters of the year.\nA surge of imports and buildup of inventories led to negative 0.5%\nannualized growth in real GDP in the first quarter, while a\ncorresponding decline in imports and inventories in the second\nquarter contributed to an annualized growth rate of 3%.1 Either\naveraging the two quarters results or reversing the effects of\nchanges in net exports and inventories would result in an\nannualized real growth rate of around 1% to 1.5%, a slowdown\nfrom prior quarters.\nAlthough equity markets are now largely looking past tariff policy\nuncertainty, modest job growth in July and large downward\nrevisions to employment growth figures from May and June2 align\nwith the recent decline in demand for industrial space and suggest\nthat a broader slowdown in the economy is underway. It remains to\nbe seen whether the slowdown in hiring is a temporary reaction to\nincreased uncertainty around tariffs or indicative of a more\nsignificant downturn. The authors are wary of predicting a near-\nterm recession, especially given the resilience of the economy over\nthe last three years despite recurring warning signs in leading\nindicators.\nThe Federal Reserve has not adjusted interest rates this year, and\nlong-term rates have remained relatively stable. Consumer price\ninflation remains at 2.7% year over year, which is within 30 basis\npoints of where it has been for the past 12 months.3 Forward\nexpectations are for the Federal Reserve to cut the federal funds\nrate by the end of 2025, especially if the employment market\nremains soft. Falling rates and greater clarity on tariffs could reduce\nuncertainty and spur greater demand for industrial space, leading to\na return to positive absorption in early 2026.\nThe Forecast Model\nThe authors use various explanatory drivers in the forecast's\n\n\nstatistical model, such as lagged net absorption, real GDP growth,\ninflation and output gaps, monetary policy, and seasonal and\nstructural effects. They rely on data from CoStar as the primary\nsource for the national industrial market; historical data from\nCoStar were used to apply an exponential smoothing technique to\neliminate seasonality. To account for the possibility of a recession,\nthe current forecast assumes there is a 21% chance of one occurring\nin 2025. This baseline out-of-sample forecast is illustrated in Figure\n1. If a recession does occur, actual net absorption is expected to\nturn more sharply negative in 2025. If a recession does not occur,\nabsorption will be higher than the current forecast.\nTable 1 provides the expected range in net absorption if a recession\ndoes not occur in 2025. Figure 1 assigns these values a 79%\nweighting. Table 2 assumes the economy experiences a recession\nbeginning in the third quarter of 2025, based on an analysis of the\nyield curve for U.S. Treasurys, the Chauvet-Piger Model and the\nWall Street Journal Economic Forecasting Survey. Figure 1 assigns\nthese values a 21% weighting.\n[image]\nThe forecast for industrial absorption in the second half of 2025 is\n2.8 million square feet, with lower and upper boundaries of -34 and\n24.9 million square feet, respectively. The predicted full-year net\nabsorption for 2026 is 119.3 million square feet, with lower and\nupper boundaries of 37.9 and 152.7 million square feet,\nrespectively. The forecast for industrial absorption in the first half\nof 2027 is 109.7 million square feet, with lower and upper\nboundaries of 75.5 and 131.6 million square feet, respectively. By\ncomparison, full-year net absorption was million square feet in\n2021, 627 million square feet in 2022, 297.4 million square feet in\n2023, and 203.1 million square feet in 2024.\n[image]\nActual Versus Forecast\nFigure 2 compares actual net absorption in the first half of 2025 to\nwhat the first-quarter forecast had projected. The first year-over-\n\n\nyear evaluation of the forecast will be provided when full-year data\nare available for 2025. During the first half of 2025, 27.0 million\nsquare feet of industrial space was absorbed, compared with the\nforecast 130 of 52.2 million square feet.\nKey Inputs and Disclaimers\nThe predictive model is funded by the NAIOP Research Foundation\nand was developed by Hany Guirguis, Ph.D., and Randy Anderson,\nPh.D., formerly of the University of Central Florida. The model,\nwhich forecasts demand for industrial space at the national level,\nutilizes variables that comprise the entire supply chain and lead the\ndemand for space, resulting in a model that can capture most\nchanges in demand.\nWhile leading economic indicators have been able to forecast\nrecessions and expansions, the indices used in this study are\nconstructed to forecast industrial real estate demand expansions,\npeaks, declines and troughs. The Industrial Space Demand model\nwas developed using the Kalman filter approach, where the\nregression parameters are allowed to vary with time and thus are\nmore appropriate for an unstable industrial real estate market.\nThe forecast is based on a process that involves testing more than\n40 economic and real estate variables that theoretically relate to the\ndemand for industrial space, including varying measures of\nemployment, GDP, exports and imports, and air, rail and shipping\ndata.

Total new quarterly \ndeliveries have remained relatively flat, with \n2.3 MSF delivered in Q2 24\u2019. When compared \non a YoY basis, total new quarterly deliveries \nare down 80% from 12.2 MSF back in Q2 2023. \nFollowing a record breaking two years of new \nconstruction, the market has returned to pre-\npandemic levels of development and delivery \nvelocity.\nWith record amounts of new supply being \ninjected into the market, total availability \nacross the market continues to face upward \npressure, now at a record high of 10.7%. Two \nmajor components of this increase are from \nan increase in sublease availability, and a \ncontinuation of new product deliveries. \nSublease availability saw a 35% QoQ increase \nup from 9.69 MSF in Q1 24\u2019 to 13.1 MSF in Q2 \n24\u2019, combined with 4.7 MSF of new product \ndelivered in the first half of 2024.\nIn the first half of 2024, 14.4 MSF was leased \nacross the Philadelphia industrial market. \nWhile this is a YoY decrease of 33.8%, it is \nimportant to keep in mind the market is \ncoming off two years of record-breaking \namounts of leasing activity, with 39.5 MSF \nleased in 2023 alone. Of the 14.4 MSF space \nleased this past quarter, 67.5% was Class A \nspace, equating to just over 9.7 MSF. 24.6% \nwas Class B space with 3.5 MSF leased, with \nClass C accounting for the remaining 8%, at \n1.1MSF of leased, respectively. \nTotal SF under construction is \nback on the rise\nTotal availability reaches a \nnew record high\nTotal SF leased in the first half \nof 2024\n14.4MSF\n10.7%\n27.9MSF\nPhiladelphia industrial market trends\nSource: AVANT by Avison Young, CoStar\n\n\nPage 3\nPhiladelphia industrial insights | Q2 2024\nNew developments continue \nto break ground across the \nmarket, with multiple master \nplanned projects underway. \nIn the first half of 2024, \nprojects 500K SF+ accounted \nfor 46% of total active \ndevelopments, with properties \n250K-499K SF accounting for \n42%.

The economy \nrebounded in 2021, growing by 6.1 percent thanks to recovery \nefforts and fiscal stimulus. By 2025, real GDP is expected to \ngrow at 2.0 percent, signaling a moderate but sustained \nexpansion. \nThe federal funds rate also experienced major shifts during \nthis period. Between 2017 and 2019, the Federal Reserve \nsteadily raised the rate from 0.65 percent to 2.40 percent as \nthe economy strengthened. In 2020, it slashed rates to near-\nzero levels (0.05 percent) to counter the pandemic\u2019s economic \nimpact, keeping the rates there through 2021. Starting in \n2022, the Federal Reserve launched an aggressive rate-hike \ncampaign to fight inflation, pushing the rate to 4.10 percent \nby the end of the year and peaking at 5.33 percent in mid-\n2023. Rates remained elevated throughout most of 2024 but \nstarted easing toward the end of the year. \nThe Forecast \nReal GDP growth is expected to decelerate over the next three years, reflecting slower economic momentum. \nIn 2025, growth is forecasted to drop to 2.0 percent, with a slight rebound to 2.1 percent in 2026, before \ntapering further to 1.8 percent in 2027, and edging back up to 1.9 in 2028. This gradual forecasted slowdown is \ndriven by rising unemployment, subdued corporate profit growth, and easing consumption rates. \nThe federal funds rate is expected to decline steadily over the same period. Analysts predict rates will decrease \nthrough 2025 before stabilizing in 2026 as inflationary pressures ease and monetary policy seeks to stimulate \neconomic activity. \nCharts 1 and 2 illustrate U.S. macroeconomic projections based on S&P\u2019s November 2024 baseline scenario. \nTable 1 highlights the annual growth rates of key economic indicators, while Table 2 provides a narrative \nsummary of various indicators. \n1\n\n\nESTIMATE DOCUMENTATION \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nECONOMIC OVERVIEW \n \nTable 1 \nForecast Change in \nKey U.S. Economic Indicators \nAnnual Percentage Growth \nIndicator \n2024p \n2025p \n2026p \n2027p \nReal GDP \n2.7 \n2.0 \n2.1 \n1.8 \nTotal Consumption \n2.7 \n2.6 \n2.3 \n2.3 \nCorporate Profits (After Tax) \n7.0 \n0.1 \n0.1 \n1.0 \nUnemployment Rate (Rate) \n4.0 \n4.4 \n4.5 \n4.6 \nCPI \n2.9 \n2.1 \n2.4 \n2.4 \nFederal Funds (Rate) \n5.15 \n3.79 \n2.64 \n2.63 \n*Assumptions in this chart, as well as other assumptions, are incorporated in the \n2025-26 fiscal year revenue estimates \np = projected \n \nTable 2 \nU.S. Macro Forecast Projection \nNovember 2024 \nBaseline Forecast (50% Probability) \nGDP Growth \nReal GDP rose 2.9% in 2023.

It slips to \n$81 in 2024 before falling to $71 in 2025. \nStock Markets \nMoody\u2019s finds that the year-end value of the S&P 500 rose 4.5% in 2023 over the \nprevious year, with growth of 25.7% in 2024 with a projected fall to 4.6% in 2025. \nInflation (CPI) \nThe Consumer Price Index (CPI) for all items increased to 4.1% in 2023 and is expected \nto moderate to 2.9% in 2024 and 2.1% in 2025. \nForeign Growth \nEurozone GDP will increase from 0.5% in 2023 to 0.7% in 2024, while China's growth will \nfall from 5.2% in 2023 to 4.9% in 2024. \nU.S. Dollar \nThe broad real dollar gently falls. \n2024 S&P Global & Moody\u2019s Analytics. \n2\n\n\nESTIMATE DOCUMENTATION \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nECONOMIC OVERVIEW \n \nPennsylvania Outlook \nPennsylvania\u2019s economy reflects a mix of opportunities and challenges shaped by its diverse industries, strategic \nlocation, shifting demographics, and evolving governmental policies. The real gross state product (GSP) is \nexpected to grow at an average annual rate of 1.5 percent through 2029. Personal income is expected to rise by \n4.4 percent annually over the same period. \nEmployment Trends and Sector Highlights \nPennsylvania\u2019s payrolls grew steadily in early 2024, with June seeing a 1.6 percent year-over-year increase, \noutpacing the national average. The health care and social services sector drove much of this growth, supported \nby gains in ambulatory care, social services, and nursing facilities. Leisure and hospitality also posted strong job \nincreases, while public-sector payrolls remain below pre-pandemic levels. Construction employment held steady \ndespite high costs and interest rates. Federal investments in infrastructure and industrial projects provided \ncrucial support for the sector. The professional and technical services industry, led by advancements in AI, \nautomation, and biosciences, is a key growth sector, with Pittsburgh emerging as an innovation hub fueled by \nthe state\u2019s numerous high-quality research universities.  \nLabor Force Dynamics \nIn the first half of 2024, Pennsylvania\u2019s labor force grew by nearly 100,000 jobs, a 1.5 percent increase compared \nto the previous year. This expansion supported job growth across various sectors, keeping unemployment steady \nin the mid-3 percent range. Unemployment is expected to rise in the out years. Long-term issues such as an \naging workforce, slower population growth, retirements, and limited migration pose challenges. Rural counties \ncontinue to face population declines. \nHousing and Construction \nHome prices in Pennsylvania have risen in recent years due to limited inventory, but the pace of growth is \nslowing. In early 2024, the Federal Housing Finance Agency reported a 7.9 percent year-over-year increase in \nhome prices, down from 8.1 percent in late 2023. Single-family home construction remains subdued, but \nmultifamily developments and senior housing projects continue to grow.  \nEnergy and Natural Resources \nPennsylvania remains the nation\u2019s second-largest natural gas producer, primarily from the Marcellus Shale. \nHowever, growth in this sector has slowed, driven by a modest decline in natural gas production from previous \nyears, as well as plateauing pipeline capacity and challenges in expanding infrastructure. Coal production, while \nstill significant, continues to decline as demand wanes and energy policies shift. Nuclear energy also plays a vital \nrole in the state\u2019s energy mix.  \nExport and Trade Strength \nIn 2023, Pennsylvania\u2019s exports hit a record $52.9 billion, led by chemicals, electronics, and machinery. Canada \nand Mexico remain the state\u2019s top trading partners. The strong export performance reflects Pennsylvania\u2019s \nrobust manufacturing and high-tech industries, which continue to attract global demand.  \n \n \n3\n\n\nESTIMATE DOCUMENTATION \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nECONOMIC OVERVIEW \n \nStrategic Location and Logistics \nPennsylvania\u2019s central location and access to major ports drive its transportation and warehousing sectors. The \nstate\u2019s proximity to major population centers, along with strong infrastructure and connectivity, supports a \nbooming logistics industry. E-commerce growth has further boosted demand for warehousing and delivery \nservices, especially in areas like Allentown. \nTable 3 shows various historical and projected key economic indicators for Pennsylvania and the U.S. economy. \n \nTable 3 \nKey Economic Indicators for Pennsylvania and the United States \n \nKey Economic Indicators \n \n2022 \n \n2023 \n \n2024 \n \n2025 \n \n2026 \n \n2027 \nReal Gross State Product (in millions, 2017 dollars) \n$ \n779,361 \n \n799,229 \n \n818,840 \n \n836,833 \n \n852,709 \n \n867,821 \nReal Gross State Product (percentage change) \n% \n1.8 \n \n2.5 \n \n2.5 \n \n2.2 \n \n1.9 \n \n1.8 \nTotal Employment (in thousands) \n \n5,984 \n6,087 \n6,177 \n6,221 \n6,217 \n6,209 \nTotal Employment (percentage change) \n% \n3.9 \n \n1.7 \n \n1.5 \n \n0.7 \n \n(0.1) \n \n(0.1) \nManufacturing Employment (in thousands) \n \n564 \n \n566 \n \n567 \n \n565 \n \n552 \n \n545 \nNonmanufacturing Employment (in thousands) \n \n5,420 \n \n5,520 \n \n5,611 \n \n5,656 \n \n5,665 \n \n5,664 \nPopulation (in thousands) \n \n12,970 \n \n12,963 \n \n12,978 \n \n13,007 \n \n13,031 \n \n13,039 \nPopulation (percentage change) \n% \n(0.3) \n \n(0.1) \n \n0.1 \n \n0.2 \n \n0.2 \n \n0.1 \nUnemployment Rate (percentage) \n% \n4.1 \n \n3.4 \n \n3.4 \n \n4.1 \n \n4.4 \n \n4.6 \nPersonal Income (percentage change) \n% \n2.2 \n \n5.3 \n \n4.7 \n \n5.1 \n \n4.9 \n \n4.7 \nCopyright 2024 S&P Global. \n \n \n4\n\n\nESTIMATE DOCUMENTATION \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMETHODOLOGY OVERVIEW \n \n \nFor the 2024-25 revised and 2025-26 budget estimates, three types of models were used: (1) econometric, (2) \nstructural, and (3) combined structural and econometric models.  An econometric model assumes that tax \nrevenues are a function of one or more economic factors.  An example of such a model is the realty transfer tax \nmodel.  Structural models forecast revenue based on the statutory requirements, on the timing of tax \nremittances, and on projected changes in aggregate liabilities.  Projected changes in tax liabilities are estimated \neither from economic data or from historic patterns. \n \nEconometric models are estimated using least squares regression.  Regression analysis assumes a relationship \nwhere the dependent variable, y, equals the sum of the products of independent variables, xn, and their \nrespective coefficients, \u03b2 n, plus an error term, e: \n \ne\nx\nx\ny\nn\nn\n+\n+\n+\n+\n=\n\u03b2\n\u03b2\n\u03b2\n...\n1\n1\n0\n \n \nA regression equation, y\nx\nx\ne\nn\nn\n=\n+\n+\n+\n+\n\u03b2\n\u03b2\n\u03b2\n0\n1 1\n...\n, differs from the true equation by an error term e.  The \nmethod of least squares regression estimates values for the coefficients \u03b2\n\u03b2\n\u03b2\n0\n1\n,\n, ...,\nn such that the sum of the \nsquared error terms is minimized.  Once a regression equation is determined, a projection of future estimates \nmay be derived using forecasts of the independent variables.  \n \nCertain econometric models need to be adjusted for a serial correlation bias.  The autoregressive coefficient of \nthe residual, \u03c1 (rho), is used to adjust these forecasts.  The corrected forecast equals: \n \n \nt\nn\nn\nt\nv\nx\nx\ny\n+\n+\n+\n+\n=\n\u03b2\n\u03b2\n\u03b2\n...\n1\n1\n0\n \n \n\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61= \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udf0c1\ud835\udc49\ud835\udc49\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61\u22121 + ... + \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc67\ud835\udc67\ud835\udc49\ud835\udc49\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61\u2212\ud835\udc67\ud835\udc67+ \ud835\udf00\ud835\udf00\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61 \n \nwhere t equals the number of observations into the forecast period and z equals the number of prior periods \nincluded in the autoregressive equation.  All models for which vt is shown are adjusted to correct for a serial \ncorrelation bias. \n \nFor further information on individual tax types, such as tax rate, tax base, subject entities, exemptions, etc., \nplease refer to the Tax Compendium. \n \n \n \n \n \n5\n\n\n2024-25\n2025-26\n2026-27\n2027-28\n2028-29\n2029-30\nREVISED\nBUDGET\nESTIMATE\nESTIMATE\nESTIMATE\nESTIMATE\n2025-26 2026-27 2027-28 2028-29 2029-30\nTotal General Fund\n46,050.3\n48,382.5\n51,212.0\n52,304.7\n53,523.2\n54,704.3\n5.1%\n5.8%\n2.1%\n2.3%\n2.2%\nTotal Tax Revenue\n44,695.6\n46,282.7\n48,661.7\n49,713.2\n50,775.1\n51,804.4\n3.6%\n5.1%\n2.2%\n2.1%\n2.0%\nTotal Corporation Taxes\n7,703.6\n7,962.0\n8,604.0\n8,100.0\n7,414.9\n6,774.3\n3.4%\n8.1%\n-5.9%\n-8.5%\n-8.6%\n  Accelerated Deposits\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n  Corporate Net Income\n5,460.5\n5,635.5\n6,471.3\n5,985.5\n5,235.4\n4,529.2\n3.2%\n14.8%\n-7.5%\n-12.5%\n-13.5%\n  Gross Receipts\n1,323.3\n1,367.0\n1,431.9\n1,461.1\n1,507.9\n1,553.8\n3.3%\n4.7%\n2.0%\n3.2%\n3.0%\n  Utility Property\n46.3\n46.9\n47.5\n48.1\n48.7\n49.4\n1.3%\n1.3%\n1.3%\n1.2%\n1.4%\n  Insurance Premium\n540.3\n551.1\n579.6\n602.9\n622.9\n641.9\n2.0%\n5.2%\n4.0%\n3.3%\n3.1%\n  Bank Shares\n308.6\n361.5\n73.7\n2.4\n0.0\n0.0\n17.1%\n-79.6%\n-96.7%\n-100.0%\n  Mutual Thrift\n24.6\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n-100.0%\nTotal Consumption Taxes\n15,762.9\n16,042.0\n16,683.1\n17,260.6\n17,854.7\n18,391.6\n1.8%\n4.0%\n3.5%\n3.4%\n3.0%\n  Sales and Use -

Analysis and discussion throughout this section are based upon data from each source in addition to \nfurther analysis from the Department of Revenue and the Office of the Budget. \n \nU.S. Recent Trends and Current Conditions \nThe forecasted real GDP growth for 2024 has been revised \nfrom 1.4% to 1.5%, driven by recent widespread easing of \nfinancial conditions. As GDP is projected to increase, the S&P \nforecast for 2024 unemployment has been revised down \nfrom 4.3% to 4.0%. \n \nA downward adjustment in the S&P unemployment forecast \nsuggests a corresponding upward adjustment in the inflation \nforecast. However, S&P did not change the CPI forecast for \n2023 due to recent favorable inflation reports combined with \nunsustainably tight labor markets. S&P revised the projected \nCPI all items forecast from 2.7% to 2.6% in 2024. \n \nS&P projects the Federal Reserve (Fed) to hold its policy rate \nof 5.25% to 5.50% through mid-2024 before reversing course \nin June 2024. While the economy\u2019s resilience has tempered \nconcerns of an imminent recession, a period of below-trend \ngrowth and an accompanying increase in the unemployment \nrate will be necessary to reduce wage growth to a range \nconsistent with core PCE inflation near the Fed\u2019s objective of \n2% within an acceptable timeframe. \n \nThe Forecast \nS&P projects real GDP will continue to grow, albeit at a rate below recent trends. With growth slowing in 2024 \nand 2025, S&P projects unemployment to rise to 4.5% by mid-2026. Corporate profits are expected to grow by \n5% in 2024, then slow to 0.4% in 2025 and rebound to 3.2% in 2026. \n \nTables 1 and 2 present U.S. macro forecast projections from S&P\u2019s December 2023 baseline scenario.

The real gross state product is \nprojected to grow at an annual average of 1.5% from 2023 to 2026. Personal income is expected to increase by \n4.8%, compared with 4.9% for the country. Pennsylvania\u2019s annual median household income grew to $74,900 \nin 2023 with an anticipated 3.0% per annum growth through 2026. Pennsylvania retail sales are expected to \nmoderate to an average annual growth of 1.6% through 2026 after experiencing above-average growth in \nrecent years. \n \nAs of December 2023, Pennsylvania total nonfarm employment was up by 2.5% from 2022 levels. As in much \nof the country, the health care and social services sector contribute the largest share of the gains, led by the \nongoing recovery in ambulatory health care services, social services, and nursing and residential care services. \nThe leisure and hospitality sector continues to post gains. Professional, scientific, and technical services will \ncontinue to be a bright spot for the state in terms of job growth and economic output gains. High-tech fields \nsuch as artificial intelligence, industrial automation, and biosciences will see the most growth, while more \ntraditional fields like legal services will see more moderate gains. The state and local government services \nsector, including public education, continues to experience weak job growth. It is the only sector where \npayrolls remain well below pre-pandemic levels, with public sector entities struggling to compete with rapidly \nrising private-sector wages. \n \nThe state\u2019s labor force has not yet recovered to its pre-pandemic peak, although the state has added around \n26,000 workers (up 0.4%) over the past year. A more robust pace of labor force growth has provided a boost to \npublic-sector hiring in other states and would likely do the same in Pennsylvania. As it stands, the state\u2019s \nunemployment rate had dropped to the mid-3 percent range by late 2023, compared with the mid-4 percent \nrange in early 2020. \n \nThe Federal Housing Finance Agency\u2019s Purchase-Only House Price Index in Pennsylvania was 4.8% higher than \na year earlier in the first quarter of 2023. This was below the national average price appreciation of 5.9% over \nthe same period and down from a 9.6% gain in the third quarter of 2022. Pennsylvania\u2019s home prices have \nsurged in recent years due to a shortage of homes for sale, but price growth is now decelerating to more \ntypical levels. \n \nAfter a decade of rapid growth, Pennsylvania\u2019s natural gas production, primarily from the Marcellus Shale, has \nplateaued since 2021. The state is the nation\u2019s second-largest natural gas producer after Texas, with expanded \npipeline capacity allowing production to reach more markets. In 2022, Pennsylvania accounted for 19% of \nmarketed U.S. natural gas production. S&P expects the rate of gain to slow in the near future, but remain \npositive, as the development of additional takeaway capacity via pipeline faces challenges on many fronts. \nConstruction activity related to the state\u2019s natural gas industry has cooled after years of completing new wells \nand building pipelines. Persistently low market prices have slowed well drilling, while the buildout of pipeline \ninfrastructure is mostly complete for now. The ethane cracker plant in Beaver County began operation in \nNovember 2022 and is expected to provide an important outlet for natural gas liquids produced in western \nPennsylvania. \n3\n\n\nESTIMATE DOCUMENTATION \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nECONOMIC OVERVIEW \n \n \nTable 3 shows various historical and projected key economic indicators for Pennsylvania and the U.S. economy. \n \nTable 3 \nKey Economic Indicators for Pennsylvania and the United States \n \nPENNSYLVANIA: Key Economic Indicators \n2021 \n2022 \n2023 \n2024 \n2025 \n2026 \nReal Gross State Product (in millions, 2012 dollars) \n764,602 \n772,336 \n789,706 \n806,419 \n816,895 \n826,770 \nReal Gross State Product (percentage change) \n3.8% \n1.0% \n2.2% \n2.1% \n1.3% \n1.2% \nTotal Employment (in thousands) \n5,759.7 \n5,990.5 \n6,140.4 \n6,181.2 \n6,171.3 \n6,163.7 \nTotal Employment (percentage change) \n2.8% \n4.0% \n2.5% \n0.7% \n(0.2)% \n(0.1)% \nManufacturing Employment (in thousands) \n544.3 \n563.6 \n566.8 \n559.5 \n536.8 \n525.7 \nNonmanufacturing Employment (in thousands.) \n5,215.4 \n5,426.9 \n5,573.6 \n5,621.7 \n5,634.4 \n5,638.0 \nPopulation (in thousands) \n13,005.3 \n12,968.7 \n12,956.7 \n12,959.9 \n12,965.3 \n12,974.3 \nPopulation (percentage change) \n0.0% \n(0.3)% \n(0.1)% \n0.0% \n0.0% \n0.1% \nUnemployment Rate (percentage) \n6.0% \n4.3% \n3.8% \n4.2% \n4.8% \n5.1% \nPersonal Income (percentage change) \n6.3% \n0.4% \n5.8% \n5.4% \n4.9% \n4.3% \nCopyright 2023 S&P Global. \n \n \n \n \n4\n\n\nESTIMATE DOCUMENTATION \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMETHODOLOGY OVERVIEW \n \n \nFor the 2023-24 revised and 2024-25 budget estimates, three types of models were used: (1) econometric, (2) \nstructural, and (3) combined structural and econometric models.  An econometric model assumes that tax \nrevenues are a function of one or more economic factors.  An example of such a model is the realty transfer \ntax model.  Structural models forecast revenue based on the statutory requirements, on the timing of tax \nremittances, and on projected changes in aggregate liabilities.  Projected changes in tax liabilities are \nestimated either from economic data or from historic patterns. \n \nEconometric models are estimated using least squares regression.  Regression analysis assumes a relationship \nwhere the dependent variable, y, equals the sum of the products of independent variables, xn, and their \nrespective coefficients, \u03b2 n, plus an error term, e: \n \ne\nx\nx\ny\nn\nn\n+\n+\n+\n+\n=\n\u03b2\n\u03b2\n\u03b2\n...\n1\n1\n0\n.  \n \nA regression equation, y\nx\nx\ne\nn\nn\n=\n+\n+\n+\n+\n\u03b2\n\u03b2\n\u03b2\n0\n1 1\n...\n, differs from the true equation by an error term e.  The \nmethod of least squares regression estimates values for the coefficients \u03b2\n\u03b2\n\u03b2\n0\n1\n,\n, ...,\nn such that the sum of \nthe squared error terms is minimized.  Once a regression equation is determined, a projection of future \nestimates may be derived using forecasts of the independent variables.  \n \nCertain econometric models need to be adjusted for a serial correlation bias.  The autoregressive coefficient of \nthe residual, \u03c1 (rho), is used to adjust these forecasts.  The corrected forecast equals: \n \n \nt\nn\nn\nt\nv\nx\nx\ny\n+\n+\n+\n+\n=\n\u03b2\n\u03b2\n\u03b2\n...\n1\n1\n0\n \n \n\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61= \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udf0c1\ud835\udc49\ud835\udc49\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61\u22121 + ... + \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc67\ud835\udc67\ud835\udc49\ud835\udc49\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61\u2212\ud835\udc67\ud835\udc67+ \ud835\udf00\ud835\udf00\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61 \n \nwhere t equals the number of observations into the forecast period and z equals the number of prior periods \nincluded in the autoregressive equation.

U.S. industrial net absorption reached 45.1 million\nsquare feet (msf) in the third quarter of 2025, a 30% increase\nquarter-over-quarter (QOQ) and 33% year-over-year (YOY).\nYear-to-date (YTD) net absorption measured 108 msf, in line\nwith the 109 msf recorded during the same period in 2024.\u00a0\n\u2022  Asking rent growth slowed but remained positive.\nNational asking rents averaged $10.10 per square foot (psf) in\nthe third quarter, up 1.7% YOY. Nearly 60% of U.S. markets\nposted positive YOY rent growth, with nine markets reporting\ndouble-digit rent increases.\n\u2022  Vacancy held steady amid positive demand and slowing\nconstruction. With new construction deliveries (63.6 msf)\nhitting an eight-year low, the national vacancy rate remained\nat 7.1% in the third quarter. While stable this quarter, the\nrate is slightly elevated from the pre-pandemic historical\naverage of 6.8%.\nFor the data behind the commentary,\ndownload the full Q3 2025 U.S. Industrial\nReport.\n\u00a0\nResilient Demand Amid Economic Uncertainty\nThe U.S. industrial market remained fundamentally healthy in the\nthird quarter despite headwinds such as cooling consumer spending,\nhigher tariffs, policy uncertainty, and a softening job market. Even\nwith these challenges, quarterly net absorption climbed by 30%\nQOQ to 45.1 msf\u2014the strongest demand-reading in more than a\nyear. Absorption was positive in two-thirds of U.S. markets, led by\n\n\nDallas-Ft. Worth, Indianapolis, Houston, Central New Jersey,\nPhoenix and Kansas City, which all recorded more than 3 msf of\ngrowth. Several markets that posted occupancy losses earlier in the\nyear, including Atlanta, Central New Jersey and San Diego,\nreturned to positive territory in the third quarter. Nationwide, 12\nmarkets surpassed 2 msf of positive absorption, double the number\nfrom the previous quarter.\nThe flight-to-quality trend remains evident in the leasing data.\nLarge corporate users are optimizing their supply chain networks by\nconsolidating operations into newer, high-utilization regional hubs.\nBuildings constructed since 2020 have registered 196 msf of net\ngrowth YTD, while older, less functional facilities have posted 88\nmsf of negative absorption.\nRent growth continues to moderate, rising by 1.7% YOY compared\nto 4% in 2024. Rent growth was positive in 57% of U.S. markets\ntracked by Cushman & Wakefield, with 15 markets posting YOY\ngains exceeding 5%. Rent declines were largely concentrated in the\nWest and Northeast regions, which were down 3.0% and 3.7% YOY,\nrespectively. Despite these declines, national asking rents remain\n60% above their pre-pandemic levels, led by the Northeast, where\nrents are now 92% higher than in the fourth\u00a0quarter of 2019.\n\u00a0\nLower Deliveries Keep Vacancy Flat\nSlowing new supply has helped keep vacancy rates in check. Just\n63.6 msf of new space was delivered during the third quarter, a\n32.5% decrease from a year ago. The share of build-to-suit (BTS)\nproduct has risen steadily since the close of 2023, accounting for\n31% of completions YTD. Only five markets posted more than 10\nmsf of new deliveries in 2025: Dallas-Ft. Worth, Phoenix, Houston,\nSavannah and the Inland Empire\u2014down from 10 markets during\nthe same period last year.\nWith construction starts below recent historical levels, the under-\nconstruction pipeline has fallen 13.4% YOY. The share of BTS\ndevelopments now accounts for 39% of the total pipeline, an\n\n\nincrease from 34% one year ago.\nWith speculative construction easing, the\nnational vacancy rate remained stable at 7.1%\nQOQ and was up just 70 basis points (bps)\nYOY\u2014the smallest increase since early 2023.\nThree of the four regions saw minimal\nmovement in vacancy on a quarterly basis,\nwhile the West region\u2019s vacancy rate edged up\n30 bps QOQ to 7.8%.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nBy size segment, small-bay warehouses (under 100,000 sf) remain\nthe tightest, with a 4.6% vacancy rate. Larger facilities (500,000 sf\nand greater) reported an 80-bp decline QOQ to 9.9%, thanks to\nmajor move-ins and BTS completions. Although tenant\nconsolidations persist in some markets, the rate at which vacant\nsublease space came online remains modest, having risen by just\n6% YOY. Some tenants have even withdrawn sublease listings to\naccommodate inventory overflow or expansion needs.\nFor the data behind the commentary,\u00a0download the full Q3\n2025 U.S. Industrial Report.\n[image]\nQ3 2025 U.S. INDUSTRIAL MARKETBEAT\nAccess Q3 2025 commercial real estate results for the industrial\nsector.\nDownload Report\nAuthor\n\u2022  Jason Price\nSenior Director, Americas Head of Logistics & Industrial\nResearch, Global Research\n\n\nRecent U.S. Industrial MarketBeat Reports\nClick on a title to download:\n\u2022  Q2 2025 U.S. Industrial MarketBeat\n\u2022  Q1 2024 U.S. Industrial MarketBeat\n\u2022  Q4 2024 U.S. Industrial MarketBeat\n\u2022  Q3 2024 U.S. Industrial MarketBeat\nU.S. MarketBeat Map\n[image]\nClick to View Interactive Map\nFeatured Insights: Current U.S.\nMarketBeats\n[image]\nMarketBeat\nU.S. Life Sciences Reports\nThe U.S. life sciences commercial real estate market continues to\nnavigate a challenging environment in 2025, although early signs of\nstabilization are emerging.

Market trends\n1.1 Supply, demand and vacancy\n- Demand remains generally robust across the state\u2019s industrial corridors, with large user requirements concentrated along the I\u201181/I\u201178 corridor that benefit from proximity to northeastern ports and population centers; nearly 7 million square feet of active space requirements were being marketed in the broader Northeast region in mid\u20112025, with 41.5% from new entrants [Source: CBRE (Northeast Industrial Logistics Construction Watch Q2 2025)].\n- Vacancy is mixed by submarket. Newmark/C \ube0cRE reporting shows Lehigh Valley and Central PA vacancy rates near the low\u2011 to mid\u20118% range (Lehigh Valley ~8.1%; Central PA ~8.1%) while Northeastern PA was ~8.7% in the aggregated I\u201181/I\u201178 view; Cushman & Wakefield reports Philadelphia region vacancies around 11.4% (city) and suburban totals nearer 8.3% depending on county [Source: CBRE (Northeast Industrial Logistics Construction Watch Q2 2025); Cushman & Wakefield (Philadelphia MarketBeat Q2 2025); Newmark (Greater Philadelphia Q2 2025)].\n- Net absorption has been uneven: Philadelphia region recorded materially positive YTD absorption in 2025 (e.g., nearly 1.4\u20133.2 msf aggregate gains with quarterly spikes) while many Central/I\u201181 corridor submarkets showed negative or modest absorption as new completions absorbed into the market [Source: Cushman & Wakefield (Philadelphia MarketBeat Q2 2025); CBRE (Northeast Industrial Logistics Construction Watch Q2 2025)].\n\n1.2 Rents and pricing\n- Asking rents vary materially by submarket and product quality. Reported weighted average asking rents range from roughly $6.50\u2013$15.43 psf for specific Philadelphia county segments (warehouse/ distribution vs. manufacturing flex mix) and state\u2011wide averages reported between ~$8.45 and ~$12.66 psf depending on dataset and product class; suburban Philadelphia NNN asking ranges reported substantially higher in certain datasets (e.g., $26\u2013$27 psf NNN for suburban Philadelphia industrial in one Q2 2025 Lee & Associates release reflecting different product definitions) [Source: Cushman & Wakefield (Philadelphia MarketBeat Q2 2025); CBRE (2025 US Real Estate Market Outlook Midyear Review); Lee & Associates (Suburban Philadelphia Market Report Q2 2025)].\n- Transaction pricing and cap rates show dispersion: recent PA industrial sales averages were cited near $104/sf (rolling 12\u2011month), with cap rates shown in the mid\u2011to\u2011high single digits for Eastern/Greater Philadelphia multi\u2011let/industrial assets (e.g., suburban Philly cap ~7.7\u20137.75% in Q2 2025) and materially wider cap rates in Western PA (Pittsburgh area showing cap rates ~10.5\u201310.7% in some reports) [Source: Lee & Associates (Q2 2025 Market Reports); Cushman & Wakefield sales comps (PA I\u201181/I\u201178 Q2 2025)].\n- Notable large transactions continue to occur (multi\u2011hundred\u2011thousand\u2011square\u2011foot leases and sales), underscoring ongoing institutional and corporate demand for modern industrial product (examples: leases >300k\u20131.2M sf in the Philadelphia region in 2025) [Source: CBRE (2025 US Real Estate Market Outlook Midyear Review); Cushman & Wakefield (Philadelphia MarketBeat Q2 2025)].\n\n1.3 Development pipeline\n- Construction pipelines have begun to moderate after a multi\u2011year expansion. Greater Philadelphia and the I\u201181/I\u201178 corridor reported significant under\u2011construction volumes earlier but a decline in pipeline square footage was noted by mid\u20112025 (regional construction pipeline down to roughly 9.8M sf in one measure), while several large speculative high\u2011clear developments (Prologis 1.1M sf at Harrisburg; Matrix 900k sf at Shippensburg) were delivered or underway [Source: CBRE (2025 US Real Estate Market Outlook Midyear Review); Newmark (Northeast Industrial Q2 2025)].\n- Speculative development activity is concentrated in Central PA and corridor locations; many large new specs remain largely available upon delivery (0% pre\u2011leased for some 900k\u20131.1M sf projects), creating concentrated supply that primarily competes for mid\u2011to\u2011large occupiers rather than the small\u2011bay multi\u2011let tenant base [Source: Newmark (Northeast/I\u201181\u201178 Corridor Q2 2025)].\n\n2. Market drivers\n2.1 Strategic location and logistics\n- Pennsylvania\u2019s central Mid\u2011Atlantic location and access to major ports (Philadelphia, New Jersey, New York) underpin structural logistics demand and favor corridor submarkets near I\u201195, I\u201178 and I\u201181 for distribution and regional fulfillment [Source: Marcus & Millichap (Philadelphia 2025 Investment Outlook); CBRE (Northeast Industrial Logistics Construction Watch Q2 2025)].\n\n2.2 Occupier shifts and product requirements\n- Larger users are chasing modern features\u2014higher clear heights (40'+), wider column spacing and increased power capacity to support automation\u2014which is pushing new development toward larger, taller buildings; this evolution affects multi\u2011let supply because many new specs target large single tenants rather than small\u2011bay multi\u2011let configurations [Source: CBRE (Northeast Industrial Logistics Construction Watch Q2 2025); Newmark (Northeast Q2 2025)].\n- Multi\u2011let occupiers remain diverse (trade counters, small manufacturers, e\u2011commerce last\u2011mile, specialized services) and tenant footprints concentrate in 500\u201350,000 sf ranges, with a particularly large share in the 5,000\u201325,000 sf mid\u2011box band [Source: Newmark (Multi\u2011let research) ; Gerald Eve (Multi\u2011let July 2024)].\n\n2.3 Labor and economic growth\n- Employment growth across industrial\u2011using sectors (trade/transportation, education & health, business services) supports continued demand; some corridor employment metrics expanded 1\u20133% YOY in mid\u20112025 even as unemployment slightly rose in places [Source: CBRE (Northeast Industrial Logistics Construction Watch Q2 2025); Cushman & Wakefield (PA I\u201181/I\u201178 MarketBeat Q2 2025)].\n\n3. Risks and challenges\n3.1 Product mismatch and concentrated speculative supply\n- Large speculative, high\u2011clear development is increasing supply tailored to big logistics users and may not be readily convertible to small\u2011bay multi\u2011let configurations, leaving a scarcity of modern small units in certain markets even as overall industrial inventory grows [Source: Newmark (Northeast/I\u201181\u201178 Q2 2025); CBRE (Northeast Industrial Logistics Construction Watch Q2 2025)].\n\n3.2 Sublease and tenant churn\n- Elevated sublease availability in some Central and Lehigh Valley markets (sublease blocks reported in excess of several hundred thousand square feet in 2024\u20131H25) creates short\u2011term downside pressure on rents and absorption for multi\u2011let landlords competing for smaller tenants [Source: Newmark (Northeast Industrial Q2 2025)].\n\n3.3 Financing and cap rate sensitivity\n- Cost of debt and cap\u2011rate dynamics remain a constraint: multi\u2011let yields compressed in late 2024/early 2025, but higher funding costs and economic uncertainty leave a finely balanced investment return outlook; cap rates vary materially by submarket (mid\u2011single digits to low double digits), exposing investors to valuation volatility [Source: Newmark (Multi\u2011let bulletins); Lee & Associates (Q2 2025 Market Reports)].\n\n3.4 Tenant credit risk among micro occupiers\n- Small business occupiers (micro units <5k sf) are more sensitive to economic stress and input cost inflation, posing higher default/turnover risk relative to larger, well\u2011capitalized industrial tenants [Source: Gerald Eve (Multi\u2011let July 2024); Newmark (Multi\u2011let research)].\n\n4. Opportunities (actionable)\n4.1 Target modernized small\u2011bay stock and retrofit value\u2011adds\n- Convert or subdivide older, well\u2011located single\u2011tenant buildings into multi\u2011let small\u2011bay units in infill locations near labor pools and last\u2011mile corridors (I\u201195, I\u2011476, core Philadelphia) to plug the supply gap for 5k\u201325k sf requirements; scarcity of suitable modern small units supports premium reversion on well\u2011positioned conversions [Source: Gerald Eve (Multi\u2011let research); Cushman & Wakefield (Philadelphia MarketBeat Q2 2025)].\n\n4.2 Corridor and submarket selection\n- Focus acquisitions in corridors with balanced fundamentals and tenant diversity: I\u201181/I\u201178 and Lehigh Valley for distribution\u2011adjacent multi\u2011let opportunities; suburban Philadelphia and parts of Central PA for trade counters, manufacturing and services tenants seeking regional access [Source: CBRE (Northeast Industrial Logistics Construction Watch Q2 2025); Cushman & Wakefield (PA I\u201181/I\u201178 MarketBeat Q2 2025); Marcus & Millichap (Philadelphia 2025 Investment Outlook)].\n\n4.3 Product differentiation: flexible power, clear height options, small\u2011unit amenity\n- Given occupier demand for increased power and automation, multi\u2011let projects that offer higher clear heights in a modular small\u2011bay format, enhanced power capacity and plug\u2011and\u2011play utility/office build\u2011outs will capture higher\u2011quality tenants and yield reversion [Source: CBRE (Northeast Industrial Logistics Construction Watch Q2 2025); Newmark (Northeast Q2 2025)].\n\n4.4 Opportunistic capital and secondary markets\n- Western PA (Pittsburgh) and smaller MSAs show wider cap rates and lower pricing per sf\u2014these markets may suit value investors seeking income and upside via active asset management, lease\u2011up and rollover capture [Source: Lee & Associates (Western Pennsylvania Q1\u2013Q2 2025 reports); Lee & Associates (PA Industrial Snapshot Q2 2025)].\n\nClosing recommendation\nPrioritize multi\u2011let investments that (1) fill modern small\u2011bay supply gaps in infill and last\u2011mile corridors; (2) require modest capex to deliver differentiated product (power, modular clear heights, trade counter frontage); and (3) target submarkets with stable employment growth but pricing inefficiencies (e.g., select Central PA and Western PA opportunities). Monitor sublease inventory and large speculative deliveries across the I\u201181/I\u201178 corridor closely; these will be the primary short\u2011term determinants of rent trajectory and absorption for multi\u2011tenant small\u2011bay assets in 2025\u20132026 [Source: Newmark (Greater Philadelphia & I\u201181/I\u201178 Q2 2025); CBRE (2025 US Real Estate Market Outlook Midyear Review); Cushman & Wakefield (Philadelphia & PA I\u201181/I\u201178 MarketBeats Q2 2025)].",
