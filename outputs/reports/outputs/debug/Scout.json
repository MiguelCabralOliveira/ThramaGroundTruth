However, the lack of pre-lettable new \ndevelopment, the erosion of suitable vacancy and unrecorded regears \nare as much the reason as more circumspect occupier demand.\nThere is ongoing rent momentum though ERV growth has slowed to \nsingle digits. Previously stronger segments further ahead in the cycle, \nsuch as Inner London, have underperformed peripheral segments \nrecently. Rental reversion is widespread but being captured. High \ndevelopment cost has intensified prime/secondary rent polarisation \nbut rising best quality secondary rents will continue to erode this gap.\nLow void rates have only marginally ticked up since the rate of new \ndevelopment is so low. Broad scarcity of stock has maintained a high \nretention rate after expiry and a record low default rate in 2023 \ndespite rising company insolvencies. Regional void rates are \neffectively bumping along the bottom. Inner London is the exception, \nand the void rate has climbed considerably, raising affordability \nquestions. Meanwhile, an encouraging acceleration in EPC \nrefurbishments across the UK has reduced overall grade D multi-let \nspace and increased EPC grade B. \nIn the occupier outlook, void rates will stop rising this year and \nremain well below the peaks of previous cycles. We continue to \nforecast a moderate U-shape nominal rental growth profile over \n2024-28 with the greatest potential for good secondary and a \nnarrower differential between geographical submarkets.\nThere is more depth to investment demand and prime yields \ntightened 25bps+ in H1 2024. Reversionary multi-let assets (notably \ngood secondary) are currently more sought after than long income \nindex-linked single-lets. Low transactions should pick up as more \nbuyers and sellers re-enter the market. Medium term industrial returns \nshould trend upwards and outperform other property sectors. \nMARKET OVERVIEW\nRead more\nRead more\n\u00a316.31psf\nERV, London & the \nSouth East Q1 2024\n1.4%\nRecord low UK multi-let \ndefault rate, 2023\n4.3%\nForecast UK multi-let \naverage annual rental \ngrowth rate, 2024-28\n\u00a38.18psf\n9.25%\nForecast UK multi-let \nvoid rate peak in 2024\n11.1%\nForecast UK multi-let \naverage annual total \nreturn, 2024-28\nERV, Rest of UK\nQ1 2024\n\n\ngeraldeve.com/services/research\nMulti-let is Gerald Eve\u2019s unique \nand market-leading syndicated \nstudy that provides detailed \nindustry-reference insight into \nwhat would otherwise be an \nopaque sector.\nThe results are built from the \nbottom up, using individual \ntenancy information on units \nbetween 500 sq ft and 50,000 \nsq ft in size. \nThe information spans 16 years, \ncovering many tens of \nthousands of individual assets \nover that time, with a sample \nsize of 147 million sq ft, valued \nat over \u00a327bn (see Dataset and \nDefinitions for further detail).\nMany thanks to the leading UK \nmulti-let industrial property \ninvestors who contribute their \ndata to make this important \nstudy possible.\nCONTRIBUTORS\nDATASET, \nDEFINITIONS &\nCONTACTS\nINVESTMENT\nSUPPLY AND \nDEVELOPMENT\nOUTLOOK\nEPCS\nCONTRIBUTORS\nOCCUPIERS\n& TAKE-UP\nINCOME\nOVERVIEW\nREGIONS\nREGIONS\n\n\ngeraldeve.com/services/research\n51% \u201cmodern usage\u201d\nMULTI-LET OCCUPIERS - FOOTPRINTS\nLondon & the South East\nRest of UK\n62% \u201cmodern usage\u201d\n\u201cModern usage\u201d defined as the less traditional, more gentrified activities of retail and logistics, quasi-office and leisure.\nMulti-let industrial is well established as a top performing UK \nproperty segment. Key to multi-let\u2019s success is its transition from \ntraditional industrial use to a diverse, modern and flexible asset class. \nThis coupled with continued very limited new development provides \na real defensiveness and resilience for the occupier market that \ncontinues to appeal to investors.\nMulti-let units in this research are between 500-50,000 sq ft in size \nand have some similarities to larger industrial units, either in \nsupporting common kinds of business activities or as a trickle-down \nsupport, such as logistics or manufacturing. The segment also \nbenefits from its own unique offering and can host quasi-\nretail/office/leisure activities such as trade counters, legal, finance, \npublic sector and other professional services, data centres, breweries \nand bakeries (perhaps with a public bar or caf\u00e9), Q-commerce and \ndark kitchens, gyms, florists, soft play, even dentists or hairdressers \nand a wide variety of other micro businesses.\nAfter a rapid period of gentrification over 2012-16, the proportion of \nstock in \u201cmodern usage\u201d has remained stable at around 61% in \nLondon & the South East and 51% in the rest of the UK. London & the \nSouth East is characterised by a greater proportion of logistics \noccupiers, notably in Greater London units over 25k sq ft where \nlogistics account for 35% of the market. Food\u2013related occupation, \nwhile relatively low nationally, has a footprint of over 17% in Inner \nLondon units under 25k sq ft. This has eased a little over the past \nyear, however, in line with softened Q-commerce requirements.\nMore peripheral UK markets have a high proportion of SME tenants, \nnotably in the North East where nearly 20% of multi-let space is \noccupied by firms with 10 or fewer employees. Meanwhile London is \ndominated by large national and multinational occupiers.\nDATASET, \nDEFINITIONS &\nCONTACTS\nINVESTMENT\nSUPPLY AND \nDEVELOPMENT\nOUTLOOK\nEPCS\nCONTRIBUTORS\nOCCUPIERS\n& TAKE-UP\nINCOME\nOVERVIEW\nREGIONS\nREGIONS\nTrade counters\n25.5%\nRetail and bus. storage\n7.4%\nLogistics\n15.5%\nFood-related\n5.4%\nGeneral manuf.\n16.0%\nHigh tech eng.\n3.7%\nOn-site servicing\n4.0%\nOff-site \nservices\n8.2%\nQuasi office\n11.6%\nLeisure\n1.7%\nIndividuals\n0.9%\nTrade counters\n22.8%\nRetail and bus. storage\n7.4%\nLogistics\n8.7%\nFood-related\n5.0%\nGeneral manuf.\n20.9%\nHigh tech eng.\n4.5%\nOn-site servicing\n4.2%\nOff-site \nservices\n11.4%\nQuasi office\n9.9%\nLeisure\n2.1%\nIndividuals\n3.1%\nMulti-let occupied floorspace by company size (see here for definitions)\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nInner London\nGreater\nLondon\nSouth East\nScotland\nEast of\nEngland\nSouth West\nYorks &\nHumber\nEast Midlands North West\nWest\nMidlands\nWales\nNorth East\nMicro\nSmall\nLarge\n% of total\nSee new take-up analysis overleaf\nSee new take-up analysis overleaf\n\n\ngeraldeve.com/services/research\nMULTI-LET TAKE-UP\nDATASET, \nDEFINITIONS &\nCONTACTS\nINVESTMENT\nSUPPLY AND \nDEVELOPMENT\nOUTLOOK\nEPCS\nCONTRIBUTORS\nOCCUPIERS\n& TAKE-UP\nINCOME\nOVERVIEW\nREGIONS\nREGIONS\nSource: Gerald Eve\nOver 50k sq ft UK industrial rolling annual take-up\nMillion sq ft \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n                     \nMillion sq ft\nSource: Gerald Eve\nMulti-let rolling annual take-up by unit size and major region\nThe recorded volume of sub-50k sq ft multi-let lettings is a similar \nmagnitude to the over 50k sq ft lettings featured in our Prime Logistics \nresearch. However, the trends before, during and post-pandemic are \nquite different. Bigger box transactions trended at 47m sq ft pre-\npandemic. Pre-let and speculatively-built take-up over covid increased \nthe rolling annual rate by around 57% - topping out at over 90m sq ft in \nlate 2021 and early 2022. This was driven not so much by an increased \nnumber of transactions but an increase in the average individual size of \ntransaction. The so-called \u201cmega-shed\u201d units of 500k sq ft+ that \ntypically account for 12% of take-up increased to 40% of the total over \ncovid. Post-pandemic take-up has broadly returned to baseline. \nIn contrast, multi-let take-up trended at a stable 62m sq ft pre-\npandemic, though this had already begun to fall over 2019. There was a \nsmall pick-up during covid, though this was nevertheless at an average \nrate some 18% below the previous period, and there has been a \nsubsequent further reduction in 2023 and 2024. Recorded multi-let \ntake-up post-pandemic is around 37% lower than pre-pandemic.\nThere are several possible reasons for this. Firstly, during the high \ninflation and recessionary economic backdrop of rising insolvencies \nmired with geopolitical uncertainty in 2023 occupiers clearly became \nmore hesitant and circumspect, particularly in the final quarter. \nHowever, viewings have increased in H1 2024 and enquiries are \ngenerally of a better quality. Getting terms agreed is time-consuming, in \npart due to the education process on how much market rents have \nincreased for occupiers coming back to regear or attempt to relocate.\nThe wider take-up trend is arguably more reflective of the inability of \nmulti-let occupiers to target new development as compared with their \nover 50k sq ft counterparts. Indeed, the bigger box trend for \nrefurbished/secondhand space is similar to multi-let. Moreover, \ndwindling multi-let availability will have compounded the issue, with \nfewer vacant units to let and more incumbent occupiers regearing \nwhere they are (with this potentially not recorded as take-up). \n6.0%\nLondon & the South East\nRest of UK\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\nQ1 2015\nQ3 2015\nQ1 2016\nQ3 2016\nQ1 2017\nQ3 2017\nQ1 2018\nQ3 2018\nQ1 2019\nQ3 2019\nQ1 2020\nQ3 2020\nQ1 2021\nQ3 2021\nQ1 2022\nQ3 2022\nQ1 2023\nQ3 2023\nQ1 2024\nLon/SE micro\nLon/SE small box\nLon/SE mid box\nROUK micro\nROUK small box\nROUK mid box\n37%\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\nQ1 2015\nQ3 2015\nQ1 2016\nQ3 2016\nQ1 2017\nQ3 2017\nQ1 2018\nQ3 2018\nQ1 2019\nQ3 2019\nQ1 2020\nQ3 2020\nQ1 2021\nQ3 2021\nQ1 2022\nQ3 2022\nQ1 2023\nQ3 2023\nQ1 2024\nRefurbished or secondhand\nPre-let or spec built\n57%\nTrade counters\n21.8%\nRetail and bus. storage\n9.2%\nLogistics\n12.0%\nFood-related\n6.8%\nGeneral manuf.\n14.0%\nHigh tech eng.\n5.5%\nOn-site servicing\n4.1%\nOff-site services\n9.8%\nQuasi office\n11.7%\nLeisure\n1.9%\nIndividuals\n3.0%\nTrade counters\n20.7%\nRetail and bus. storage\n10.0%\nLogistics\n8.8%\nFood-related\n4.2%\nGeneral manuf.\n21.2%\nHigh tech eng.\n4.7%\nOn-site servicing\n4.1%\nOff-site services\n11.5%\nQuasi office\n9.9%\nLeisure\n1.9%\nIndividuals\n3.0%\nSource: Gerald Eve\n5-year average take-up distribution by business activity and major region\n\n\ngeraldeve.com/services/research\nTRADE COUNTERS: The largest individual segment in multi-let continues to be \nthe mainstay of occupier demand. After a sustained period in wait-and-see \nmode, trade counters are back in the market to some extent. Many will still seek \nlease renewals, but replacements are being sought for space that is no longer \nworking (typically being too small or in some cases insufficient EPC credentials).\nLOGISTICS: An integral part of the industrial market clustered around the UK\u2019s \ndensely-populated urban centres. Structural e-commerce tailwinds continue to \nsupport parcel & post occupiers. However, the proportion of online spend has \nreturned to its pre-pandemic trend and strong take-up over recent years means \noperations are mostly catered for and well represented across key centres.\nFOOD-RELATED: Q-commerce was the disruptive new entrant in recent years, \nrivalling logistics occupiers to establish networks with last-touch depots in \npremier locations. The sector has now matured, and the retrenchment from the \nUK for some operators (such as Getir) has eased overall requirements for \nadditional multi-let space. \nGENERAL MANUFACTURING: This longstanding traditional activity in multi-let \nhas been crowded out to some extent but continues to have the second largest \nfootprint after trade counters in many UK regions.  Demand for smaller industrial \nunits is supported by increased take-up in the bigger boxes in 2024 across key \nUK manufacturing regional hubs.\nHIGH-TECH ENGINEERING: The more specialist end of the production industries \nin multi-let occupies a smaller and typically more expensive footprint. Occupier \ndemand has been buoyed in recent years by pharmaceutical R&D, and through \ntechnological advances in the automotive industry and aeronautics. An \nacceleration in the use of AI is likely to provide a boost in the coming years.\nON-SITE SERVICING: A diminishing component of the multi-let occupier \nfootprint, certainly in the institutional portfolios. MOT centre operators now \naccount for only low single digit percentages of floorspace. The business model \nfor these types of tenants is under threat as automotive technology moves on \nand multi-let rent affordability becomes more of an issue.\nOFF-SITE SERVICES: This segment includes vehicle & equipment hire along \nwith activities related to the construction sector. It is a challenging period for \nconstruction, reflected in its 40% average share of UK company insolvencies. \nHowever, there has been limited passthrough to multi-let and units have not \ncome back to the market with any regularity. \nQUASI-OFFICE: This segment can include any type of office use, for example \npublic sector, legal, finance and more broadly the creative industries. The \ndiversity of demand and the flexibility and relative affordability compared with \ntraditional offices gives this segment real defensive resilience. Data centre use \nprovides another significant opportunistic strand of future demand.\nLEISURE: The occupier footprint is relatively small and tends towards health \nand fitness when nearer urban centres and child-friendly play and/or sports \nsuch as karting in more peripheral locations. Occupiers that rely on \ndiscretionary spend are under pressure currently and the default risk is higher \nthan several of the other multi-let use types.\nINDIVIDUALS: These micro business tend to represent the smallest component \nof multi-let occupier demand. However, some pockets remain quite prevalent \nin more peripheral locations outside of the South East in sub-5,000 sq ft units. \nThe current unpredictability of economic activity coupled with high input cost \ninflation and strained borrowing affordability puts these tenants at high risk.\nMULTI-LET OCCUPIERS \u2013 BUSINESS SECTOR OVERVIEW\nDATASET, \nDEFINITIONS &\nCONTACTS\nINVESTMENT\nSUPPLY AND \nDEVELOPMENT\nOUTLOOK\nEPCS\nCONTRIBUTORS\nOCCUPIERS\n& TAKE-UP\nINCOME\nOVERVIEW\nREGIONS\nREGIONS\n\n\ngeraldeve.com/services/research\n-2\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n14\nMay-22\nJul-22\nSep-22\nNov-22\nJan-23\nMar-23\nMay-23\nJul-23\nSep-23\nNov-23\nJan-24\nMar-24\nMay-24\nIndustrial\nOffice\nRetail\nINCOME \u2013 TOP LEVEL ERVs\n\u00a37.50/\u00a311.25\nSCOTLAND\nNORTH \nEAST\nNORTH \nWEST\nYORKS & \nHUMBER\nSOUTH \nWALES\nWEST \nMIDLANDS\nEAST \nMIDLANDS\nEASTERN\nSOUTH WEST\nSOUTH EAST\nLONDON\n\u00a36.30/\u00a310.00\n\u00a37.30/\u00a310.75\n\u00a38.10/\u00a311.25\n\u00a310.60/\u00a311.00\nGreater \u00a318.00/\u00a322.00\nInner \u00a324.40/\u00a337.75\n\u00a312.50/\u00a316.75\n\u00a37.10/\u00a313.00\n\u00a37.40/\u00a312.25\n\u00a36.50/\u00a39.25\n\u00a38.00/\u00a313.00\nSource: MSCI\nAll-grades annual rental growth by sector\n% \n \n \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n                     \nIndustrial annual rental growth on the MSCI measure has fallen back \nto mid-single digits, which is around half of the rate of the recent \npeak of the market in 2022.

Rents in this \npart of the sector are more freely subject to market forces and the \nbetter-quality secondary rents have continued to rise and erode the \nlarge gap with prime.\nSource: Gerald Eve\nPrime and all-grades market rents by region, Q1 2024\n \n \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n                     \nAll-grades average (psf)\nPrime (psf)\nDATASET, \nDEFINITIONS &\nCONTACTS\nINVESTMENT\nSUPPLY AND \nDEVELOPMENT\nOUTLOOK\nEPCS\nCONTRIBUTORS\nOCCUPIERS\n& TAKE-UP\nINCOME\nOVERVIEW\nREGIONS\nREGIONS\n\n\ngeraldeve.com/services/research\nINCOME \u2013 ERV IN MORE DETAIL\n\u00a3 per sq ft\nSource: Gerald Eve, MSCI\nMulti-let ERVs by major region (annual growth labelled in brackets)\nDATASET, \nDEFINITIONS &\nCONTACTS\nINVESTMENT\nSUPPLY AND \nDEVELOPMENT\nOUTLOOK\nEPCS\nCONTRIBUTORS\nOCCUPIERS\n& TAKE-UP\nINCOME\nOVERVIEW\nREGIONS\nREGIONS\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n2020\n2021\n2022\n2023\nInner London\nGreater London\nSouth East\nRest of UK\nAs with MSCI data, the Multi-let study ERV growth slowed considerably \nin 2023 and into 2024. The stronger segments in London that are ahead \nin the cycle slowed the most while traditionally weaker segments \noutperformed in 2023 and caught up somewhat. ERV growth in the \nregions outside of the South East outperformed in 2023 for only the \nsecond time on record (previously in 2016).\nSignificant reversion is widespread but has now peaked and is being \ncaptured in some places (e.g. London), which is a positive indicator for \naffordability. As previously mentioned, the polarisation of prime over \nthe rest of the market stepped up in 2021 along with reversion and this \nwas still very elevated in 2023. This is especially the case in Inner \nLondon where none of the floorspace in the study sample was valued \nat the \u00a340 psf prime headline rent level. This reflects the thinness of the \nprime market (and potentially presents a development opportunity).\nSource: Gerald Eve\nMulti-let ERV annual growth rates\n% \n \n \n \n(11.3%)\n(6.5%)\n(4.8%

exercise a break dropped \nconsiderably in the years leading up to 2015 and has been consistent \nat around 25% since then. Similarly, the retention of occupiers after an \nexpiry trended upwards and peaked at 75% in 2017. There was some \nvolatility over covid, with a boost in 2020 during various lockdowns \nand with government business support. Subsequently there was a \ndrop to around 50% in 2021, reflecting a shakeout of pent-up occupier \nactivity and landlords seeking to capture rental reversion and move \ncertain weaker tenants on. The most recent data from 2023 suggests a \nreturn to stability with a retention rate of around 70%.\nThe multi-let default rate is more cyclical and has historically tracked \nthe wider UK company insolvency rate fairly closely. In the last couple \nof years the insolvency rate has trended upwards. Increased interest \nrates and wage costs have risen sharply and thus UK companies, \nparticularly the smaller firms which took on more debt over covid than \ntheir larger counterparts, have been under considerable financial \nstress. These pressures are nevertheless less acute than during the \nglobal financial crisis, and the current rate of insolvencies appears to \nhave recently peaked.\nInterestingly though, the two series have diverged over the last two \nyears and the 2023 multi-let default rate fell to a record low of only \n1.4%. It seems that the data now reflect longstanding reports from the \nmarket that multi-let defaults are relatively uncommon, despite the \ninsolvencies in the economy, and space has not been coming back. In \npart this divergence could be explained by the current scarcity of \nsuitable multi-let units. During previous periods of economic weakness \nand relative unit abundance the rent might have been the first thing \nforfeit, but now accommodation is much more likely to be retained \nsince the chance of finding an alternative in the future would be very \ndifficult. This is consistent with the decreased propensity to exercise a \nbreak and elevated expiry retention rate.\nSource: Gerald Eve\nMulti-let propensity to exercise a break\n% of break events exercised\nSource: Gerald Eve\nMulti-let proportion of tenants retained after lease expiry\n%\nSource:  Gerald Eve, ONS, The Insolvency Service\nMulti-let default rate and company insolvency rate\nDefault rate, %  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUK company insolvency rate, % \n \n \n \n70.2%\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023\nCovid \nimpact\n25%\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n2011\n2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023\n1.4%\n0.0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n2010\n2011\n2012\n2013\n2014\n2015\n2016\n2017\n2018\n2019\n2020\n2021\n2022\n2023\nUK Default rate\nInsolvency rate (RHS)\nRelationship between company \ninsolvency rate and multi-let \ndefault rate diverges\n\n\ngeraldeve.com/services/research\nDATASET, \nDEFINITIONS &\nCONTACTS\nINVESTMENT\nSUPPLY AND \nDEVELOPMENT\nOUTLOOK\nEPCS\nCONTRIBUTORS\nOCCUPIERS\n& TAKE-UP\nINCOME\nOVERVIEW\nREGIONS\nREGIONS\nMULTI-LET OCCUPIERS \u2013 INCOME RISK PROFILE\n%\nSource: Gerald Eve\n5-year average annual risk by component, occupier type and major region\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n14\n16\nBreaks\nExpiries\nDefaults\nLondon & the South East\nRest of UK\n\n\ngeraldeve.com/services/research\nSUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT\nDATASET, \nDEFINITIONS &\nCONTACTS\nINVESTMENT\nSUPPLY AND \nDEVELOPMENT\nOUTLOOK\nEPCS\nCONTRIBUTORS\nOCCUPIERS\n& TAKE-UP\nINCOME\nOVERVIEW\nREGIONS\nREGIONS\n%\nSource: Gerald Eve, MSCI\nMulti-let void rates by major region\n%\nSource: Gerald Eve\nVoid rates by region, 2022 and 2023\n6.0%\n10.7%\n10.4%\n7.4% 7.9%\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n2010\n2011\n2012\n2013\n2014\n2015\n2016\n2017\n2018\n2019\n2020\n2021\n2022\n2023\nQ1 2024\nLondon & the South East\nRest of UK\n0\n3\n6\n9\n12\n15\n18\n2023\n2022\n14.0m\nsq ft\n3.3m sq ft\n8.7m sq ft\nLess than ONE \nMONTH of \nsupply at current \ntake-up rates\nSource:  Gerald Eve, Property Data\nUK multi-let development pipeline by status\nDevelopment pipeline records suggest there are currently 191 multi-\nlet schemes at a planning stage or under construction across the UK, \ntotalling a potential 14.0 million sq ft. Activity continues to be limited \nby high development cost relative to market capital value, which \nultimately require premium quoting rents on new schemes to make \nthem viable. These will be payable by only a small fraction of the \nmulti-let occupier base. The most active region is the North West, \nwith a little over a million sq ft over 19 different schemes due to \ncomplete by 2025. The key message, however, continues to be that \nthis is all marginal in the context of the overall size of the UK multi-\nlet market, which is conservatively estimated to be over half a billion \nsq ft. Even at recent relatively subdued take-up rates there is less \nthan one month of supply currently under construction.\nMulti-let industrial void rates at the major regional level usually \nmove in the same direction and historically London & the South East \nhas been 2.5%pts below the rest of the UK. However, in 2023 the \nLondon & the South East void rate not only increased while the rest \nof the UK fell, but it also widened the gap above the regions to an \nall-time high of 3.3%pts. The South East and Greater London ticked \nup to 9.6% and 9.7% respectively in 2023, but the major driving force \nbehind the increase was Inner London. The Inner London void rate \nhas been on an upward trend since 2016 and reached a recent peak \nof 17.8% in 2022. This was due in part to the speculative completion \nof some schemes at the end of 2022 that were subsequently let \nearly in 2023. However, expectations of a more sizeable drop by \nend-2023 were confounded and it fell back only slightly to 17.4%. \nThe driving forces in this trend are the premium micro and small box \nunits of less than 25k sq ft.\nThe Inner London data come from the study sample (albeit a large \none) and not the full population so there is potential for inaccuracy. \nIt is also worth noting the ERV distribution on page 9 that shows \nmost of the Inner London multi-let floorspace was valued in the \nhigh \u00a320s and early \u00a330s per sq ft rather than the prime ERV of \u00a340 \nper sq ft. However, the question of affordability must be raised in \nthis context and whether a period of consolidation is now in order \nwhile the high level of reversion is wound down. There is some \nvolatility, but in the regions outside of the South East five out of \nnine geographies recorded a decrease in void rate in 2023. All \nregions other than Scotland and the South West had a lower void \nrate than the South East. Those locations where the void rate \nslightly increased, such as the North West and East Midlands remain \nrelatively low at under 7%. This seeming bumping along the bottom \nis symptomatic of a market with extremely low new development.\nSee pipeline schemes by region overleaf\nSee pipeline schemes by region overleaf\n2.1m sq ft\nPlanning applied, 15%\nPlanning consented, 62%\nUnder construction, 23%\n\n\ngeraldeve.com/services/research\nSUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT\nMillion sq ft\nSource:  Gerald Eve, Property Data\nMulti-let development pipeline by region, no. of schemes (and average scheme size)\nSource:  Gerald Eve, Property Data\nSchemes under construction by expected completion dates, no. of schemes (and average scheme size) \nThousands sq ft\nDATASET, \nDEFINITIONS &\nCONTACTS\nINVESTMENT\nSUPPLY AND \nDEVELOPMENT\nOUTLOOK\nEPCS\nCONTRIBUTORS\nOCCUPIERS\n& TAKE-UP\nINCOME\nOVERVIEW\nREGIONS\nREGIONS\n(73,468 sq ft) \n(98,195 sq ft) \n(72,229 sq ft) \n(63,431 sq ft) \n(67,779 sq ft) \n(221,509 sq ft) \n(37,083 sq ft) \n(56,140 sq ft) \n(42,887 sq ft) \n(70,882 sq ft) \n(56,233 sq ft) \n64\n31\n16\n16\n14\n4\n18\n10\n9\n5\n5\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\nNorth West\nSouth East\nLondon\nSouth West\nYorkshire &\nHumberside\nEastern\nEast Midlands West Midlands\nWales\nScotland\nNorth East\nPlanning applied\nPlanning consented\nUnder construction\n(57,911 sq ft) \n(91,941 sq ft) \n(357,500 sq ft) \n(24,597 sq ft) \n(42,297 sq ft) (65,562 sq ft) \n(63,845 sq ft) \n(56,128 sq ft) \n(46,500 sq ft) \n(67,822 sq ft) \n19\n8\n1\n10\n5\n3\n2\n2\n2\n1\n0\n200\n400\n600\n800\n1,000\n1,200\nNorth West\nSouth East\nEastern\nEast Midlands\nSouth West\nLondon\nWales\nYorkshire &\nHumberside\nWest Midlands\nScotland\nNorth East\n\"2023\"\n2024\n2025\nUndated\nAround 2.7 MONTHS of supply \nat current take-up rates\nAround 1.4 MONTHS of supply \nat current take-up rates\n\n\ngeraldeve.com/services/research\nOCCUPIER MARKET OUTLOOK\nSource:  MSCI, Gerald Eve\nAll-grades multi-let rental growth\n% \n \n \n      \nSource: Gerald Eve\nSource:  Gerald Eve, ONS, The Insolvency Service\nMulti-let default rate and company insolvency rate\nModelling suggests that the end-year 2024 UK company insolvency rate \nwill peak at around three-quarters of the rate observed during the GFC \nperiod. The multi-let default rate was a record low 1.4% in 2023 and \nwhile it may step up fractionally in 2024 in line with insolvencies, the \ndivergence of these two formerly closely-related series due to scarcity \nof multi-let units is set to continue into the forecast period.\nMinimal new development and defaults, along with some tenant churn \nare relatively narrow channels to generate increased multi-let voids. \nAny increases during the current period of economic weakness should \nconclude by end-2024. The \u201cpeak\u201d in vacancy rates in London & the \nSouth East anticipated in 2024 is likely to be moderate in a historical \ncontext and come in at under 11%. From 2025, as the market gradually \nconsolidates void rates are likely to ease. London & the South East \nbenefits from the covenant strength and relative rent insensitivity of a \nsignificant proportion of larger national and international occupiers, and \nthis should be helpful in bringing voids down. Meanwhile in the rest of \nthe UK the void rate is likely to continue bumping along the bottom and \nnot fall below the rate at the peak of the market in 2021.\nRental growth is expected to form a U-shape recovery. Lower but \npositive and rising nominal rental growth will be maintained as the \neconomic recovery gains traction, and there will likely be a narrower \nrange between multi-let submarkets. The best-performing segment will \nlikely be good quality secondary space where rents have been closing \nthe gap with the high prime rents required to justify new development.\nReversion will continue to be captured and the spread between passing \nand market rents will continue to fall from the exceptionally high levels \nof 2021.

The formulation for how certain \nattributes in particular combinations qualify for different EPC scores \nis not made public and can shift from one year to the next. \nHowever, the regulatory deadlines opposite have been established \nand continue to be worked towards by multi-let landlords.\nThe Multi-let EPC distribution spans from A \u2013 G and is split here \naccording to major UK geography and by size of unit. The main \ncluster for both regions continues to be around grade C. Units in \nLondon & the South East tend to be of a higher EPC rating, with \nnotably larger proportions of A and B grade units. Across all \nsegments the larger mid box units tend to be better EPC specified \nthan their smaller and micro unit counterparts.\nThere have been substantive changes to the landscape over the \nthree years since EPC information was introduced to the study. \nThere has been a drift towards the higher quality left hand side of \nthe distributions for both major UK regions, with an acceleration in \n2023 as landlords appear, encouragingly, to have stepped up their \nengagement with the initiative. Units rated F&G have no longer \nbeen lettable since the first regulatory deadline in April 2023 and \nthere are now only trace amounts of these kinds units in the sample.\nThe next key deadline is in just under three years in April 2027 when \nany unit rated grade D or below will no longer be compliant. This \naccounts for 27% of multi-let space in London & the South East, \nwhich has fallen from 30% in 2022 and 26% in 2021. There has been \neven greater progress in the regions outside of the South East \nwhere 36% of the market needs refurbishment intervention by 2027, \nwhich is down from 49% in 2022 and 51% in 2021.\nDATASET, \nDEFINITIONS &\nCONTACTS\nINVESTMENT\nSUPPLY AND \nDEVELOPMENT\nOUTLOOK\nEPCS\nCONTRIBUTORS\nOCCUPIERS\n& TAKE-UP\nINCOME\nOVERVIEW\nREGIONS\nREGIONS\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\nA\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nMicro\nSmall box\nMid box\n34%\n39%\n27%\n<0.5%\n2027+\n27% of the market needs \nrefurbishment \nintervention by 2027 (30% \nin 2022; 36% in 2021)\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\nA\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nMicro\nSmall box\nMid box\n24%\n39%\n35%\n<1%\n2027+\n36% of the market needs \nrefurbishment \nintervention by 2027 (49% \nin 2022; 51% in 2021)\nSee the evolution of multi-let EPCs overleaf\nSee the evolution of multi-let EPCs overleaf\n\n\ngeraldeve.com/services/research\nEPCs \u2013 MULTI-LET EVOLUTION\nUnits rated EPC grade C-G will be non-compliant from 2030 and are a \nkey target for refurbishment. In 2023, landlords outside of the South \nEast upgraded the EPC rating on 18% of this kind of space, up from \n12% in 2022. This excellent and increased rate of engagement helps \nexplain how the EPC landscape is changing so rapidly in this region. \nLondon & the South East was also impressive, with 14% upgraded in \n2023 following 8% in 2022.\nLandlords report that they typically uprate units when they become \nvacant. However, many units will be continuously occupied yet also \nneed improvement. Across the UK, an impressive 12% of let and \noccupied C-G space underwent an EPC rating uplift in 2023, up from \n8% in 2022. Occupied upgrades are thus clearly possible and represent \nanother strength for multi-let over office and retail counterparts.\nGrade B continues to be the most popular target EPC grade (over 60% \nof refurbishments in London & the South East and 37% in the regions \noutside in 2023). It is the most cost-effective option since it can \ntypically be achieved by improving heating and lighting systems, while \nmore intrusive roof-based PV panels are not required. For the most \npart, grade A EPCs are the domain of new development. \nConsequently, there has been a sharp reduction in grade D space over \nthe past three years and a steep increase in grade Bs. Grade C units are \nrefurbished to as well as from so the level has been more constant.\nThere is an ERV hierarchy of EPC grades, A-E, valued relatively higher \nto lower. This will capture EPC credentials along with various other \nquality characteristics. However, at this point of slowdown and catch-\nup of weaker segments in the cycle, lower grade EPC units have \ntypically had stronger ERV growth over the past year. Thus, even \ncontrolling for other quality characteristics it is not yet possible to \ncalculate an ERV \u201cgreen premium\u201d. However, other factors, such as \nyield and liquidity, will likely be impacted.\nSource: Gerald Eve\nUK multi-let ERVs by EPC grade & rental growth in 2023\nSource: Gerald Eve\nTarget EPC grade for refurbishments in 2023\nProportion of total, %\nSource: Gerald Eve\nProportion of EPC grade C-G floorspace upgraded, 2022 & 23\nProportion of total, %\nSource: Gerald Eve\nUK multi-let EPC grade proportions, 2021-23\nDATASET, \nDEFINITIONS &\nCONTACTS\nINVESTMENT\nSUPPLY AND \nDEVELOPMENT\nOUTLOOK\nEPCS\nCONTRIBUTORS\nOCCUPIERS\n& TAKE-UP\nINCOME\nOVERVIEW\nREGIONS\nREGIONS\n8%\n18%\n31%\n24%\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n2021\n2022\n2023\nEPC D\nEPC B\nEPC E\n14%\n18%\n12%\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\nLondon & the South East\nRest of UK\nAll UK, fully let only\n2022\n2023\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\nA\nB\nC\nD\nLondon & the South East\nRest of UK\n5.5%\n6.4%\n7.8%\n9.3%\n7.8%\n6\n8\n10\n12\n14\n16\n18\nA\nB\nC\nD\nE\n2022\n2023\nProportion of total, %\n\u00a3 per sq ft\n\n\ngeraldeve.com/services/research\nINVESTMENT MARKET\nSource: Gerald Eve\nPrime multi-let yields by region\nSource: Gerald Eve, MSCI\nMulti-let annual total return and components\n%\nSource: Gerald Eve, MSCI\nTotal return by sector\n%\n\u00a3bn\nSource: Gerald Eve\nIndustrial investment transaction volumes by segment\nThe expectation that Q4 2023 was the bottom of the investment \nmarket appears to have borne itself out. Sentiment has continued to \nimprove over 2024, there is more breadth and depth to the buyer \npool than at the start of the year and prime yields in the direct \nmarket are estimated to have moved in by 25bps+ in H1. There is \nstrong investor demand for all grades of quality, but 'good secondary' \nis proving especially popular where there is perceived to be greater \nrental headroom compared with new prime stock. Reversionary \nmulti-let assets are currently more sought after than their long \nincome index-linked single-let counterparts.\nCompleted transactions were subdued in the first half of 2024, in part \nas a hangover from the dearth of activity at the end of 2023. Another \nlimiting factor though so far in 2024 has been the lack of investment \nsupply, given the stage in the cycle. However, the volume of sellers \nhas increased recently, and transaction volume should be higher in \nthe second half of the year. It is arguably more acceptable to make \nassets available now that the bottom of the market was sufficiently \nlong ago, plus the perceived opportunity cost of significant price \nincreases over the short term is limited, given the relatively narrow \nscope for yield compression.\nLingering core inflation concerns have divided the market on whether \nthe Bank Rate will have its first cut in August. The broader \nexpectation remains, however, that it will be reduced over several \nincrements by the end of 2025. Thus, the cost and availability of debt \nshould continue to become (moderately) more accommodating. The \noutlook is positive and annual industrial returns should trend upwards \nover the medium term and outperform the other property sectors \u2013 \nnotably in 2025/26 when there may be some small scope for further \ninward yield shift.\nDATASET, \nDEFINITIONS &\nCONTACTS\nINVESTMENT\nSUPPLY AND \nDEVELOPMENT\nOUTLOOK\nEPCS\nCONTRIBUTORS\nOCCUPIERS\n& TAKE-UP\nINCOME\nOVERVIEW\nREGIONS\nREGIONS\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n14\n16\n18\n2017\n2018\n2019\n2020\n2021\n2022\n2023\nH1 2024\nMulti-let\nSingle let\nPortfolio\nEquivalent yield, %\n5.58\n4.75 5.00 5.25 5.25 5.50 5.50 5.50 5.50 5.75 6.00 6.25 6.75\nInner London\nGreater London\nSouth East\nNorth West\nSouth West\nEast Midlands\nWest Midlands\nYorks and Humber\nEastern\nScotland\nNorth East\nSouth Wales\n3.75\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\nQ2 2021\nQ4 2021\nQ2 2022\nQ4 2022\nQ2 2023\nQ4 2023\nQ2 2024\nUK average \nprime yield\nUK average\nQ2 2024\n-30\n-20\n-10\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n2017\n2018\n2019\n2020\n2021\n2022\n2023\n2024\n2025\n2026\nIncome return\nRental growth\nYield impact\nTotal return\nForecast\n(& est. annual total)\n11.1%\n-25\n-20\n-15\n-10\n-5\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n1-year\n3-year\n5-year\n10-year\nSince 1986\n2024-28\nRetail\nOffice\nIndustrial\nAll Property\nAverage annual to May 2024\n\n\ngeraldeve.com/services/research\nSCOTLAND\nNORTH \nEAST\nNORTH \nWEST\nYORKS & \nHUMBER\nSOUTH \nWALES\nWEST \nMIDLANDS\nEAST \nMIDLANDS\nEASTERN\nSOUTH WEST\nSOUTH EAST\nLONDON\nMULTI-LET REGIONS\nClick on a region to jump to the page \nfor more detailed analysis and insight. \nDATASET, \nDEFINITIONS &\nCONTACTS\nINVESTMENT\nSUPPLY AND \nDEVELOPMENT\nOUTLOOK\nEPCS\nCONTRIBUTORS\nOCCUPIERS\n& TAKE-UP\nINCOME\nOVERVIEW\nREGIONS\nREGIONS\n\n\ngeraldeve.com/services/research\nLONDON\nContinue with this region\nContinue with this region\n\u00a3 per sq ft\nSource: Gerald Eve, MSCI\nAll-grades ERV by area\nQ2 prime rents and equivalent yields\nSource: Gerald Eve\nInner London\nGreater London\nE\nN\nF\nI\nE\nL\nD\n\u00a327.00\nper sq ft\nC\nR\nO\nY\nD\nO\nN\n\u00a322.50\nper sq ft\nP\nA\nR\nK\nR\nO\nY\nA\nL\n\u00a335.00\nper sq ft\nH\nE\nA\nT\nH\nR\nO\nW\n\u00a328.00\nper sq ft\nI\nN\nN\nE\nR\nL\nO\nN\nD\nO\nN\n\u00a340.00\nper sq ft\nS\nL\nO\nU\nG\nH\n\u00a325.00\nper sq ft\nW\nE\nS\nT\nT\nH\nU\nR\nR\nO\nC\nK\n\u00a318.50\nper sq ft\n\u00a3 per sq ft\nSource: Gerald Eve\nQ1 all-grades ERV by unit size and % premium/discount\nGreater London\nInner London\nINNER LONDON\n4.75%\nQ2 EQUIVALENT YIELD\n5.00% Q4\nGREATER LONDON\n5.00%\nQ2 EQUIVALENT YIELD\n5.25% Q4\nDATASET, \nDEFINITIONS &\nCONTACTS\nINVESTMENT\nSUPPLY AND \nDEVELOPMENT\nOUTLOOK\nEPCS\nCONTRIBUTORS\nOCCUPIERS\n& TAKE-UP\nINCOME\nOVERVIEW\nREGIONS\nREGIONS\n\u00a325.12\n\u00a318.69\n10.0\n12.5\n15.0\n17.5\n20.0\n22.5\n25.0\n27.5\n2017\n2018\n2019\n2020\n2021\n2022\n2023\nQ1 2024\n15.8%\n0.2%\n-5.7%\n8.2%\n-1.3%\n-0.8%\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\nMulti-let Micro\nSmall\nbox\nMid box\nMulti-let Micro\nSmall\nbox\nMid box\n\n\ngeraldeve.com/services/research\nLONDON\nInner London\nGreater London\nSource: Gerald Eve, Property Data\nDevelopment pipeline\n1.2m sq ft total\nLondon is the UK\u2019s most densely populated city and has the largest \nprime multi-let market in the UK.

Multi-let rental growth has slowed since 2021/22 but estimates \nsuggest an annualised 2024 growth rate in the mid-single digits - \nsimilar to 2023 and easily outpacing the other major property sectors. \nIn recent quarters, London rental growth has fallen back to either \nbelow or more closely aligned with regions outside of the South East.\nAll risk metrics suggest relative scarcity of space and the \ndevelopment pipeline is minimal. Vacancy rates continue to be \nrelatively flat for regions outside of the South East and are expected \nto stop rising this year in London. Rental growth is expected to form a \nU-shape recovery with a similar profile in 2025 to 2024. Reversion will \ncontinue to be captured while market rental growth edges up over \nthe medium term with a narrower geographic submarket variance.\nThe industrial investment market is one of the strongest segments of \ncommercial property and the 2024 investment volume is set to finish \njust ahead of 2023. Liquidity has continued to improve over 2024 with \nmore participants across the risk spectrum, from prime to value-add \nassets. There is renewed appetite for transactions of scale \u2013 either \nlarge single estates or portfolio deals. Meanwhile, sellers can now \nbring product to the market without the stigma of being distressed.\nMulti-let yields have sharpened over the past two months. Most \nindustrial transactions in 2024 have been for multi-let, which has \noffered more capturable reversion than its longer-let single asset \ncounterpart. Market projections of the Bank Rate have been volatile \naround the Autumn Budget, but the central scenario is for a further \n100bps in 2025 to end the year at 3.75%. The returns outlook is \ncautiously positive, though the cost of debt compared with property \nyields still presents a finely-balanced picture. Overall, the combination \nof rental growth momentum and some positive yield impact points to \ncontinued dominance for industrial over the other sectors.\nMARKET OVERVIEW\nRead more\nRead more\n\u00a316.82psf\nERV, London & the \nSouth East Q3 2024\n1.4%\nRecord low UK multi-let \ndefault rate, 2023\n4.6%\nForecast UK multi-let \naverage annual rental \ngrowth rate, 2024-28\n\u00a38.40psf\n9.8%\nExpected UK multi-\nlet 2024 void rate peak\n10.9%\nForecast UK multi-let \naverage annual total \nreturn, 2024-28\nERV, Outside of \nthe South East\nQ3 2024\n\n\ngeraldeve.com/services/research\nCONTACTS\nREGIONS\nSUPPLY AND \nDEVELOPMENT\nOUTLOOK\nINVESTMENT\nCONTRIBUTORS\nOCCUPIERS\nDATASET & \nDEFINITIONS\nINCOME\nOVERVIEW\nMulti-let is Gerald Eve\u2019s unique \nand market-leading syndicated \nstudy that provides detailed \nindustry-reference insight into \nwhat would otherwise be an \nopaque sector.\nThe results are built from the \nbottom up, using individual \ntenancy information on units \nbetween 500 sq ft and 50,000 \nsq ft in size. \nThe information spans 16 years, \ncovering many tens of \nthousands of individual assets \nover that time, with a sample \nsize of 147 million sq ft, valued \nat over \u00a327bn (see Dataset and \nDefinitions for further detail).\nMany thanks to the leading UK \nmulti-let industrial property \ninvestors who contribute their \ndata to make this important \nstudy possible.\nCONTRIBUTORS\n\n\ngeraldeve.com/services/research\nCONTACTS\nREGIONS\nSUPPLY AND \nDEVELOPMENT\nOUTLOOK\nINVESTMENT\nCONTRIBUTORS\nOCCUPIERS\nDATASET & \nDEFINITIONS\nINCOME\nOVERVIEW\n51% \u201cmodern usage\u201d\nMULTI-LET OCCUPIERS - FOOTPRINTS\nLondon & the South East\nRest of UK\n62% \u201cmodern usage\u201d\n\u201cModern usage\u201d defined as the less traditional, more gentrified activities of retail and logistics, quasi-office and leisure.\nTrade counters\n25.5%\nRetail and bus. storage\n7.4%\nLogistics\n15.5%\nFood-related\n5.4%\nGeneral manuf.\n16.0%\nHigh tech eng.\n3.7%\nOn-site servicing\n4.0%\nOff-site \nservices\n8.2%\nQuasi office\n11.6%\nLeisure\n1.7%\nIndividuals\n0.9%\nTrade counters\n22.8%\nRetail and bus. storage\n7.4%\nLogistics\n8.7%\nFood-related\n5.0%\nGeneral manuf.\n20.9%\nHigh tech eng.\n4.5%\nOn-site servicing\n4.2%\nOff-site \nservices\n11.4%\nQuasi office\n9.9%\nLeisure\n2.1%\nIndividuals\n3.1%\nMulti-let occupied floorspace by company size (see here for definitions)\n% of total\nMulti-let industrial is well established as a top performing UK \nproperty segment. Key to multi-let\u2019s success is its transition from \ntraditional industrial use to a diverse, modern and flexible asset class. \nThis coupled with continued very limited new development provides \na real defensiveness and resilience for the occupier market that \ncontinues to appeal to investors.\nMulti-let units in this research are between 500-50,000 sq ft in size \nand have some similarities to larger industrial units, either in \nsupporting common kinds of business activities or as a trickle-down \nsupport, such as logistics or manufacturing. The segment also \nbenefits from its own unique offering and can host quasi-\nretail/office/leisure activities such as trade counters, legal, finance, \npublic sector and other professional services, data centres, breweries \nand bakeries (perhaps with a public bar or caf\u00e9), Q-commerce and \ndark kitchens, gyms, florists, soft play, even dentists or hairdressers \nand a wide variety of other micro businesses.\nAfter a rapid period of gentrification over 2012-16, the proportion of \nstock in \u201cmodern usage\u201d has remained stable at around 61% in \nLondon & the South East and 51% in the rest of the UK. London & the \nSouth East is characterised by a greater proportion of logistics \noccupiers, notably in Greater London units over 25k sq ft where \nlogistics account for 35% of the market. Food\u2013related occupation, \nwhile relatively low nationally, has a footprint of over 17% in Inner \nLondon units under 25k sq ft. This has eased a little over the past \nyear, however, in line with softened Q-commerce requirements.\nMore peripheral UK markets have a high proportion of SME tenants, \nnotably in the North East where nearly 20% of multi-let space is \noccupied by firms with 10 or fewer employees. Meanwhile London is \ndominated by large national and multinational occupiers.\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nInner London\nGreater\nLondon\nSouth East\nScotland\nEast of\nEngland\nSouth West\nYorks &\nHumber\nEast Midlands North West\nWest\nMidlands\nWales\nNorth East\nMicro\nSmall\nLarge\n\n\ngeraldeve.com/services/research\nCONTACTS\nREGIONS\nSUPPLY AND \nDEVELOPMENT\nOUTLOOK\nINVESTMENT\nCONTRIBUTORS\nOCCUPIERS\nDATASET & \nDEFINITIONS\nINCOME\nOVERVIEW\nMULTI-LET OCCUPIERS \u2013 BUSINESS SECTOR OVERVIEW\nTRADE COUNTERS: The largest individual segment in multi-let continues to be \nthe mainstay of occupier demand. After a sustained period in wait-and-see \nmode, trade counters are back in the market to some extent. Many will still seek \nlease renewals, but replacements are being sought for space that is no longer \nworking (typically being too small or in some cases insufficient EPC credentials).\nLOGISTICS: An integral part of the industrial market clustered around the UK\u2019s \ndensely-populated urban centres. Structural e-commerce tailwinds continue to \nsupport parcel & post occupiers. However, the proportion of online spend has \nreturned to its pre-pandemic trend and strong take-up over recent years means \noperations are mostly catered for and well represented across key centres.\nFOOD-RELATED: Q-commerce was the disruptive new entrant in recent years, \nrivalling logistics occupiers to establish networks with last-touch depots in \npremier locations. The sector has now matured, and the retrenchment from the \nUK for some operators (such as Getir) has eased overall requirements for \nadditional multi-let space. \nGENERAL MANUFACTURING: This longstanding traditional activity in multi-let \nhas been crowded out to some extent but continues to have the second largest \nfootprint after trade counters in many UK regions.  Demand for smaller industrial \nunits is supported by increased take-up in the bigger boxes in 2024 across key \nUK manufacturing regional hubs.\nHIGH-TECH ENGINEERING: The more specialist end of the production industries \nin multi-let occupies a smaller and typically more expensive footprint. Occupier \ndemand has been buoyed in recent years by pharmaceutical R&D, and through \ntechnological advances in the automotive industry and aeronautics. An \nacceleration in the use of AI is likely to provide a boost in the coming years.\nON-SITE SERVICING: A diminishing component of the multi-let occupier \nfootprint, certainly in the institutional portfolios. MOT centre operators now \naccount for only low single digit percentages of floorspace. The business model \nfor these types of tenants is under threat as automotive technology moves on \nand multi-let rent affordability becomes more of an issue.\nOFF-SITE SERVICES: This segment includes vehicle & equipment hire along \nwith activities related to the construction sector. It is a challenging period for \nconstruction, reflected in its 40% average share of UK company insolvencies. \nHowever, there has been limited passthrough to multi-let and units have not \ncome back to the market with any regularity. \nQUASI-OFFICE: This segment can include any type of office use, for example \npublic sector, legal, finance and more broadly the creative industries. The \ndiversity of demand and the flexibility and relative affordability compared with \ntraditional offices gives this segment real defensive resilience. Data centre use \nprovides another significant opportunistic strand of future demand.\nLEISURE: The occupier footprint is relatively small and tends towards health \nand fitness when nearer urban centres and child-friendly play and/or sports \nsuch as karting in more peripheral locations. Occupiers that rely on \ndiscretionary spend are under pressure currently and the default risk is higher \nthan several of the other multi-let use types.\nINDIVIDUALS: These micro businesses tend to represent the smallest component \nof multi-let occupier demand. However, some pockets remain quite prevalent in \nmore peripheral locations outside of the South East in sub-5,000 sq ft units. The \ncurrent unpredictability of economic activity coupled with high input cost \ninflation and strained borrowing affordability puts these tenants at high risk.\n\n\ngeraldeve.com/services/research\nMULTI-LET OCCUPIERS \u2013 RISK PROFILE\n%\nSource: Gerald Eve\n5-year average annual risk by component, occupier type and major region\nCONTACTS\nREGIONS\nSUPPLY AND \nDEVELOPMENT\nOUTLOOK\nINVESTMENT\nCONTRIBUTORS\nOCCUPIERS\nDATASET & \nDEFINITIONS\nINCOME\nOVERVIEW\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n14\n16\nBreaks\nExpiries\nDefaults\nLondon & the South East\nRest of UK\n\n\ngeraldeve.com/services/research\n-10\n-5\n0\n5\n10\n15\nQ3 2019\nQ4 2019\nQ1 2020\nQ2 2020\nQ3 2020\nQ4 2020\nQ1 2021\nQ2 2021\nQ3 2021\nQ4 2021\nQ1 2022\nQ2 2022\nQ3 2022\nQ4 2022\nQ1 2023\nQ2 2023\nQ3 2023\nQ4 2023\nQ1 2024\nQ2 2024\nQ3 2024\nRetail\nOffice\nIndustrial\nINCOME - ERVs\n\u00a37.55/\u00a313.50\nSCOTLAND\nNORTH \nEAST\nNORTH \nWEST\nYORKS & \nHUMBER\nSOUTH \nWALES\nWEST \nMIDLANDS\nEAST \nMIDLANDS\nEASTERN\nSOUTH WEST\nSOUTH EAST\nLONDON\n\u00a37.00/\u00a310.50\n\u00a38.10/\u00a311.40\n\u00a38.10/\u00a312.70\n\u00a310.65/\u00a310.90\nGreater \u00a319.25/\u00a323.35\nInner \u00a325.85/\u00a340.00\n\u00a313.15/\u00a317.35\n\u00a37.65/\u00a313.70\n\u00a37.75/\u00a313.20\n\u00a36.50/\u00a310.15\n\u00a38.50/\u00a313.50\nSource: MSCI\nAll-grades rental growth by sector\nAnnual rental growth, % \n \n \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n                     \nSource: Gerald Eve\nPrime and all-grades market rents by region, Q3 2024\n \n \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n                     \nAll-grades average (psf)\nPrime (psf)\nCONTACTS\nREGIONS\nSUPPLY AND \nDEVELOPMENT\nOUTLOOK\nINVESTMENT\nCONTRIBUTORS\nOCCUPIERS\nDATASET & \nDEFINITIONS\nINCOME\nOVERVIEW\nSource:  Gerald Eve\nPrime multi-let rental growth by region\nAnnual rental growth, % \n \n \n      \n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\nQ3 2019\nQ4 2019\nQ1 2020\nQ2 2020\nQ3 2020\nQ4 2020\nQ1 2021\nQ2 2021\nQ3 2021\nQ4 2021\nQ1 2022\nQ2 2022\nQ3 2022\nQ4 2022\nQ1 2023\nQ2 2023\nQ3 2023\nQ4 2023\nQ1 2024\nQ2 2024\nQ3 2024\nInner London\nGreater London\nSouth East\nRest of UK\n\n\ngeraldeve.com/services/research\nINCOME - ERVs\n\u00a3 per sq ft\nSource: Gerald Eve, MSCI\nMulti-let ERVs by major region\nCONTACTS\nREGIONS\nSUPPLY AND \nDEVELOPMENT\nOUTLOOK\nINVESTMENT\nCONTRIBUTORS\nOCCUPIERS\nDATASET & \nDEFINITIONS\nINCOME\nOVERVIEW\nMulti-let rental growth has slowed since the particularly intense \nperiod over 2021 and 2022 but estimates of rents over 2024 suggest \nan annualised growth rate in the mid-single digits - similar to 2023 \nand easily outpacing the other major property sectors.\nThe pandemic acceleration disproportionately impacted London \nmarkets. Inner London prime rent hit a remarkable 43% annual \ngrowth rate in Q1 2022. The cumulative growth rate over Q3 2020 \u2013 \nQ3 2024 was 78% - compared with 52% for Greater London and \n43% growth for both the South East and the regions outside.\nThis has arguably stretched affordability in London, along with a \nrapid increase in reversion and the polarisation between prime and \nsecondary rents. Thus, in recent quarters, London rental growth has \nfallen back to either below or at least more closely aligned with \nregions outside of the South East as previously weaker locations \nthat are behind in the cycle catch up to some degree. High rental \nreversion is widespread, but it continues to be captured across the \nUK now that market rental growth has slowed.\nPrime rents continue to be determined by the relatively high cost of \ndevelopment and represent only a small proportion of the market. \nMost multi-let occupiers occupy secondary and refurbished space. \nHere rents are more freely subject to market forces and, along with \ngreater incentives and more favourable lease terms, good quality \nsecondary rents have outperformed prime over 2024.\nThe 2024 lettings market continues to be hard fought, as numerous \neconomic and political curveballs create challenges for occupiers. \nDealmaking also continues to be drawn out while tenants that have \nbeen away from such negotiations for some years come to terms \nwith the new rental tone.\n\u00a316.82\n\u00a38.40\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n2009\n2010\n2011\n2012\n2013\n2014\n2015\n2016\n2017\n2018\n2019\n2020\n2021\n2022\n2023\nQ1 2024\nQ2 2024\nQ3 2024\n69%\n87%\n100%\nLondon & the \nSouth East\nRest of UK\n\n\ngeraldeve.com/services/research\nSUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT\nSource: Gerald Eve, Property Data\nUK multi-let development pipeline by status\nMillion sq ft\nSource:  Gerald Eve, Property Data\nMulti-let development pipeline by region, no. of schemes (and average scheme size)\nSource:  Gerald Eve, Property Data\nExpected completion dates of schemes under construction by region, no. of schemes (and average scheme size)\nMillions sq ft\nDevelopment pipeline records suggest there are currently 354 multi-\nlet schemes either in planning or under construction across the UK, \ntotalling a potential 17.9 million sq ft. Activity continues to be limited \nby high development cost relative to market capital value. Viability  \nrequires premium quoting rents on new schemes that will be \naffordable to only a small fraction of the multi-let occupier base; \nthus, any development scheme needs very careful appraisal before it \nis progressed. The most active region is the North West, with a little \nover a 1.2m sq ft under construction over 23 different schemes. Most \ndevelopments are speculative, with final completion dates not \nexplicitly specified until suitable tenants are secured. The overall \npipeline continues to be marginal in the context of the overall size of \nthe UK multi-let market, which is conservatively estimated to be over \nhalf a billion sq ft.

Leading indicator estimates of the trajectory \nover the first three quarters of 2024 continue to be relatively flat for \nregions outside of the South East and have drifted up for London & the \nSouth East, driven most likely by Inner London.\nNevertheless, tenant behaviour continues to characterise relative \nsupply scarcity. The development pipeline will do little to influence \nfuture void rates, while various risk measures are at a cyclically low ebb. \nThe propensity to exercise a break fell steeply after the last downturn \nand has for the past 10 years been stable at around only one in five \ninstances. Conversely, tenant retention after an expiry trended steeply \nupwards over 2012-17 and, notwithstanding some covid volatility and \nvariation across tenant type, has stabilised up at around 70%.\nThe rate of UK company insolvencies likely peaked in July this year at \naround three-quarters of the rate observed during the global financial \ncrisis. However, the multi-let default rate was a record low 1.4% in 2023 \nand while it may step up a little in 2024 the divergence of these two \nformerly closely-related series is set to continue over the forecast.\nTenant churn is a relatively narrow channel to impact occupied space, \nand thus from 2025 onwards we expect void rates to ease. This will \nparticularly be the case in London & the South East, which has more \nvacant space to absorb and will ultimately benefit from the covenant \nstrength of a relatively greater proportion of less rent-sensitive large \nnational and international occupiers. Meanwhile in the rest of the UK \nthe void rate is likely to continue bumping along the bottom and not \nfall below the rate at the peak of the market in 2021.\nRental growth is expected to form a U-shape recovery with a similar \nprofile in 2025 to 2024. Reversion will continue to be captured while \nmarket rental growth edges up over the medium term, and there will \nlikely be a narrower variance between multi-let submarkets.\n6.0%\nCONTACTS\nREGIONS\nSUPPLY AND \nDEVELOPMENT\nOUTLOOK\nINVESTMENT\nCONTRIBUTORS\nOCCUPIERS\nDATASET & \nDEFINITIONS\nINCOME\nOVERVIEW\nSource:  Gerald Eve, ONS, The Insolvency Service\nMulti-let default rate and UK company insolvency rate\n% \n \n \n \n \n                  %\n \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n                     \n5.0%\n4.0%\n5.6%\n5.1%\n4.6%\n6.1%\n3.8%\n5.3%\n5.2%\n6.0%\n6.5%\n5.0%\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\nWales\nNorth East\nEastern\nYorks & Humber\nEast Midlands\nScotland\nSouth West\nWest Midlands\nNorth West\nSouth East\nGreater London\nInner London\n\u00a3 per sq ft\n2024\n2023\n2028\nSouth East multi-let\nLondon multi-let\nRest of UK multi-let\nUK distribution warehouse\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n2010\n2011\n2012\n2013\n2014\n2015\n2016\n2017\n2018\n2019\n2020\n2021\n2022\n2023\n2024\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028\nUK Default rate\nInsolvency rate (RHS)\nForecast\n\n\ngeraldeve.com/services/research\n-30\n-20\n-10\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n2017\n2018\n2019\n2020\n2021\n2022\n2023\n2024\n2025\n2026\nIncome return\nRental growth\nYield impact\nTotal return\nForecast\n5.45\n4.75 4.90 5.15 5.25 5.25 5.25 5.40 5.40 5.60\n6.00 6.00 6.50\nInner London\nGreater London\nSouth East\nNorth West\nSouth West\nEast Midlands\nWest Midlands\nYorks and Humber\nEastern\nScotland\nNorth East\nSouth Wales\n3.75\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\nQ3 2021\nQ1 2022\nQ3 2022\nQ1 2023\nQ3 2023\nQ1 2024\nQ3 2024\nUK average \nprime yield\nINVESTMENT MARKET\nSource: Gerald Eve\nPrime multi-let yields by region\nSource: Gerald Eve\nIndustrial investment transaction volumes by segment\n\u00a3bn\nSource:  Gerald Eve, MSCI\nTotal return by sector\n% return over the quarter or annualised to September 2024\n%\nSource:  MSCI, Gerald Eve\nMulti-let annual total return and components\nThe industrial investment market is one of the strongest segments of \ncommercial property. Investment volumes may still ostensibly appear \nlight compared with the bumper years of 2021 and 2022, but the total \nfor 2024 is set to come in slightly higher than the \u00a36.6bn recorded in \n2023, which will easily surpass any of the years 2017-2020. Liquidity \nhas continued to improve over 2024 and there is now a greater depth \nof capital and more participants across the asset risk spectrum, from \nprime to value-add assets. However, core plus money is still relatively \nlight and this could present an opportunity in 2025. There is renewed \nappetite for transactions of scale \u2013 either large single estates or \nportfolio deals. Meanwhile, sellers can bring product to the market \nwith confidence and no longer carry the stigma of being distressed.\nYields in the direct market have sharpened over the past two months, \nparticularly for multi-let assets. Most individual and portfolio \ninvestment transactions in 2024 have been for multi-let, which has \nbeen perceived as offering more capturable reversion than its longer-\nlet single asset counterpart. The average transacted yield has been \nflat, however, since the typical quality of asset traded in 2024 has \nbeen somewhat lower than in 2023 now that sellers are not so \ncompelled to put up only their most liquid prime assets.\nValuations-based yields have been much smoother than in the direct \nmarket and there is scope for some inward movement in 2025, \narguably more so for single-let than multi-let, given the current price \ndifferential. Market projections of the Bank Rate have been volatile \naround the Autumn Budget, but the central scenario is for a further \n100bps in 2025 to end the year at 3.75%. The outlook is cautiously \npositive, though the cost of debt compared with property yields still \npresents a finely-balanced picture. Overall, the combination of rental \ngrowth and some positive yield impact points to continued total \nreturn dominance for industrial over the other sectors.\nCONTACTS\nREGIONS\nSUPPLY AND \nDEVELOPMENT\nOUTLOOK\nINVESTMENT\nCONTRIBUTORS\nOCCUPIERS\nDATASET & \nDEFINITIONS\nINCOME\nOVERVIEW\nEquivalent yield, %\nUK average\nQ3 2024\n11.4%\n-10\n-5\n0\n5\n10\n15\nQuarter\nYear\n3 Years\n5 Years\n10 Years\nSince\n1986\ninception\n2024-28\nRetail\nOffice\nIndustrial\n\u00a34.5bn\n\u00a34.7bn\n\u00a33.4bn\n\u00a36.1bn\n\u00a317.3bn\n\u00a311.8bn\n\u00a36.6bn\n\u00a34.8bn\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n14\n16\n18\n20\n2017\n2018\n2019\n2020\n2021\n2022\n2023\n2024\nMulti-let\nSingle-let\nPortfolio\nQ1 to Q3\n\n\ngeraldeve.com/services/research\nSCOTLAND\nNORTH \nEAST\nNORTH \nWEST\nYORKS & \nHUMBER\nSOUTH \nWALES\nWEST \nMIDLANDS\nEAST \nMIDLANDS\nEASTERN\nSOUTH WEST\nSOUTH EAST\nLONDON\nMULTI-LET REGIONS\nClick on a region to jump to the page \nfor more detailed analysis and insight. \nCONTACTS\nREGIONS\nSUPPLY AND \nDEVELOPMENT\nOUTLOOK\nINVESTMENT\nCONTRIBUTORS\nOCCUPIERS\nDATASET & \nDEFINITIONS\nINCOME\nOVERVIEW\n\n\ngeraldeve.com/services/research\nLONDON\nContinue with this region\nContinue with this region\n\u00a3 per sq ft\nSource: Gerald Eve, MSCI\nAll-grades ERV by area\nQ3 prime rents and equivalent yields\nSource: Gerald Eve\nInner London\nGreater London\nE\nN\nF\nI\nE\nL\nD\n\u00a327.50\nper sq ft\nC\nR\nO\nY\nD\nO\nN\n\u00a323.50\nper sq ft\nP\nA\nR\nK\nR\nO\nY\nA\nL\n\u00a335.00\nper sq ft\nH\nE\nA\nT\nH\nR\nO\nW\n\u00a328.00\nper sq ft\nI\nN\nN\nE\nR\nL\nO\nN\nD\nO\nN\n\u00a340.00\nper sq ft\nS\nL\nO\nU\nG\nH\n\u00a327.00\nper sq ft\nW\nE\nS\nT\nT\nH\nU\nR\nR\nO\nC\nK\n\u00a318.50\nper sq ft\n\u00a3 per sq ft\nSource: Gerald Eve\nQ3 all-grades ERV by unit size and % premium/discount\nGreater London\nInner London\nINNER LONDON\n4.75%\nQ3 EQUIVALENT YIELD\n4.75% Q2\nGREATER LONDON\n4.90%\nQ3 EQUIVALENT YIELD\n5.00% Q2\nCONTACTS\nREGIONS\nSUPPLY AND \nDEVELOPMENT\nOUTLOOK\nINVESTMENT\nCONTRIBUTORS\nOCCUPIERS\nDATASET & \nDEFINITIONS\nINCOME\nOVERVIEW\n\u00a324.82\n\u00a325.84\n\u00a318.47\n\u00a319.23\n10.0\n12.5\n15.0\n17.5\n20.0\n22.5\n25.0\n27.5\n2018\n2019\n2020\n2021\n2022\n2023\nQ1 2024\nQ2 2024\nQ3 2024\n15.8%\n0.2%\n-5.7%\n8.2%\n-1.3%\n-0.8%\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\nMulti-let\nMicro\nSmall\nbox\nMid box\nMulti-let\nMicro\nSmall\nbox\nMid box\n\n\ngeraldeve.com/services/research\nCONTACTS\nREGIONS\nSUPPLY AND \nDEVELOPMENT\nOUTLOOK\nINVESTMENT\nCONTRIBUTORS\nOCCUPIERS\nDATASET & \nDEFINITIONS\nINCOME\nOVERVIEW\nLONDON\nInner London\nGreater London\nSource: Gerald Eve, Property Data\nDevelopment pipeline\n1.3m sq ft total\nLondon is the UK\u2019s most densely populated city and has the largest \nprime multi-let market in the UK.

A more significant 26% is under \nconstruction in the East Midlands, with 246,00 sq ft over 10 schemes \nto be delivered in Q4 2024 and into 2025. \nTHE MIDLANDS\nEast Midlands\nWest Midlands\nSource: Gerald Eve, Property Data\nDevelopment pipeline\nWest Midlands\n1.1m sq ft total\nEast Midlands\n948k sq ft total\nSource: Gerald Eve\nProportion of floorspace by unit size\nSource: Gerald Eve\nFloorspace by EPC grade (& deadline to non-compliance)\nProportion, %\nWest Midlands\nEast Midlands\n2030\n2027\n2023\nNone\n23%\n48%\n30%\nMicro 29%\nSmall box 46%\nMid box 25%\nTrade counters\n26.9%\nRetail and bus. storage\n7.1%\nLogistics\n8.9%\nFood-related\n5.6%\nGeneral manuf.\n19.1%\nHigh tech eng.\n3.9%\nOn-site servicing\n3.2%\nOff-site services\n10.3%\nQuasi office\n10.7%\nLeisure\n0.6%\nIndividuals\n3.7%\nTrade counters\n22.5%\nRetail and bus. storage\n6.8%\nLogistics\n9.2%\nFood-related\n4.1%\nGeneral manuf.\n24.5%\nHigh tech eng.\n3.9%\nOn-site servicing\n4.8%\nOff-site services\n10.3%\nQuasi office\n11.3%\nLeisure\n0.9%\nIndividuals\n1.7%\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\nA\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\n39%\n35%\n26%\nPlanning applied 24%\nPlanning consented 68%\nUnder construction 8%\n\n\ngeraldeve.com/services/research\nSOUTH WEST AND WALES\nContinue with this region\n\u00a3 per sq ft\nSource:  Gerald Eve, MSCI\nAll-grades ERV by area\nQ3 prime rents and equivalent yields\nSource: Gerald Eve\nSouth West\nWales\nC\nA\nR\nD\nI\nF\nF\n\u00a310.50\nper sq ft\nN\nE\nW\nP\nO\nR\nT\n\u00a39.75\nper sq ft\nB\nR\nI\nS\nT\nO\nL\n\u00a314.50\nper sq ft\nG\nL\nO\nU\nC\nE\nS\nT\nE\nR\n\u00a312.50\nper sq ft\n\u00a3 per sq ft\nSource: Gerald Eve\nQ3 all-grades ERV by unit size and % premium/discount\nWales\nSouth West\nSOUTH WEST\n5.40%\nQ3 EQUIVALENT YIELD\n5.50% Q2\nSOUTH WALES\n6.50%\nQ3 EQUIVALENT YIELD\n6.75% Q2\nCONTACTS\nREGIONS\nSUPPLY AND \nDEVELOPMENT\nOUTLOOK\nINVESTMENT\nCONTRIBUTORS\nOCCUPIERS\nDATASET & \nDEFINITIONS\nINCOME\nOVERVIEW\n\u00a38.09\n\u00a38.47\n\u00a36.37\n\u00a36.52\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n2018\n2019\n2020\n2021\n2022\n2023\nQ1 2024\nQ2 2024\nQ3 2024\n7.6%\n2.9%\n-20.8%\n16.9%\n-5.6%\n-15.1%\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\nMulti-let\nMicro\nSmall\nbox\nMid box\nMulti-let\nMicro\nSmall\nbox\nMid box\n\n\ngeraldeve.com/services/research\nCONTACTS\nREGIONS\nSUPPLY AND \nDEVELOPMENT\nOUTLOOK\nINVESTMENT\nCONTRIBUTORS\nOCCUPIERS\nDATASET & \nDEFINITIONS\nINCOME\nOVERVIEW\nThis region\u2019s north easterly area is a significant big box logistics \nlocation that connects with the M5 motorway on the fringe of the \nWest Midlands market and provides good connectivity to the wider \nUK motorway network.

Edinburgh prime rents took a large step up to \n\u00a315 per sq ft in Q2 2024 following the completion of Capital Park. This \nrepresents the new absolute prime and the best-in-class rent \nbenchmark in Scotland. It is not only an excellent addition to raise the \noverall quality of the Scottish multi-let offering, but it also highlights \na differential between Edinburgh and Glasgow. In part this reflects \nthe greater amount of spare potential space in Glasgow. Land prices \nare sufficiently high in Edinburgh to require quoting rents on a new \ndevelopment to be \u00a315 per sq ft.

This was the first fall in nearly three \nyears following the historic low of 3.6% at the end of 2022. Robust demand, a sharp uptick in \nspace under offer and limited speculative development suggest availability will peak in 2025, \nthough ongoing release of secondary space will moderate any sharp contraction.\nTotal UK take-up was 13.2m sq ft in Q3, which was down 5% on Q2 but 6% higher than a \nyear earlier. Deal execution time continues to be relatively drawn out, but demand is diverse, \nforward-looking and mostly expansionary. Tenant activity includes supply chain optimisation, \nnew overseas entrants and government-backed growth sectors such as defence and \ntechnology. Pre-lets and development sales made up about half of all demand in Q3, which \nwas overwhelmingly focused on new, good quality space.\nUK prime annual rental growth slowed again to 3%, the weakest since Q2 2020. In most \ncases growth was concentrated on lettings for newly completed developments. Incentives \nremain elevated as landlords seek to support occupancy and headline rent levels. The \nvolume of speculative development starts dropped 36% to 1.8m sq ft, well below the five-\nyear average, which also continues to support prime rents.\nIn the investment market, debt conditions have materially improved, and pricing is expected \nto remain firm in H2. Investor underwriting is cautious, but there is increased liquidity in the \nmarket, particularly for portfolios, supported by new equity raised through corporate activity \nand joint ventures.\n\n\n3\nNMRK.COM/UK\nNMRK.COM/UK\nContents and Overview\n13.2m sq ft\nQ3 take-up\nDemand\n \nThe annual rate of take-up continues to trend up as retailers upgrade, companies position for future e-commerce growth, 3PLs expand and new overseas entrants take space.\n13.2m sq ft\nQ3 take-up\nDemand\nThe annual rate of take-up \ncontinues to trend up as \nretailers upgrade, companies \nposition for future \ne-commerce growth, 3PLs \nexpand and new overseas \nentrants take space.\n7.9%\nUK availability rate\nAvailability\nThe UK availability rate fell for the first time in almost three years in Q3.

Total take-up reached \n13.2 million sq ft, up 6% year-on-year and only marginally below the \n10-year average. Demand continues to show both depth and \ndiversity, driven by occupiers restructuring and upgrading their \ndistribution networks, new international entrants to the market and \nexpansion within government-backed sectors such as defence and \ntechnology. Space under offer and forward-looking indicators more \ngenerally are improving. Active demand is supported by optimising \nsupply chains, new overseas entrants, expanding 3PLs and \ncompanies in the defence industry.\nStrong demand for space in the East Midlands\nLeasing activity continues to be driven by occupiers seeking greater \noperational efficiency, focusing demand on modern, energy-efficient \nbuildings that are ready for immediate occupation.

However, \na significant amount of new capital has been raised globally, and \ndeployment of this will commence and continue over 2026, which \npoints to improved depth and liquidity to the investment market next \nyear. Most of this new capital is targeting value-add returns, but core \nplus buyers are set to return in greater depth in 2026. This will mark \nthe early stage of a recovery in a market that has been subdued over \n2025. On the supply side, a significant volume of unsold stock is likely \nto remain from 2025.

With limited speculative development in the pipeline, market \nconditions continue to support a broadly positive outlook for prime rental growth.\n\n\n14\nNMRK.COM/UK\nNMRK.COM/UK\nLondon\n \nContact Josh Pater for more information.\nContact Josh Pater \nfor more information.\n%\nAvailability rate by region\nSource: Newmark\nAverage months on market, unweighted\nVoid period by region, Q3 2025\nSource: Newmark\nMillion sq ft\nOccupier take-up\nSource: Newmark\nTake-up by occupier sector, last 12 months\nSource: Newmark\nMillion sq ft\nDevelopment completions, by type\nSource: Newmark\n%, per year\nPrime logistics regional average annual rental growth\nSource: Newmark\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\nQ4\n2022\nQ1\n2023\nQ2\n2023\nQ3\n2023\nQ4\n2023\nQ1\n2024\nQ2\n2024\nQ3\n2024\nQ4\n2024\nQ1\n2025\nQ2\n2025\nQ3\n2025\nLondon East\nLondon North\nLondon South\nLondon West\nUK average\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\n2.0\n2.5\n3.0\nQ4\n2022\nQ1\n2023\nQ2\n2023\nQ3\n2023\nQ4\n2023\nQ1\n2024\nQ2\n2024\nQ3\n2024\nQ4\n2024\nQ1\n2025\nQ2\n2025\nQ3\n2025\nPurpose-built\nSpeculative\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\nLondon East\nLondon\nNorth\nLondon\nSouth\nLondon\nWest\nUK average\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\nQ4\n2022\nQ1\n2023\nQ2\n2023\nQ3\n2023\nQ4\n2023\nQ1\n2024\nQ2\n2024\nQ3\n2024\nQ4\n2024\nQ1\n2025\nQ2\n2025\nQ3\n2025\nLondon East\nLondon North\nLondon South\nLondon West\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\n2.0\n2.5\n3.0\nQ4\n2022\nQ1\n2023\nQ2\n2023\nQ3\n2023\nQ4\n2023\nQ1\n2024\nQ2\n2024\nQ3\n2024\nQ4\n2024\nQ1\n2025\nQ2\n2025\nQ3\n2025\nLondon\n5-year average\nLogistics\n8%\nManufacturing\n6%\nOther/unknown\n4%\nRetail & \nWholesale\n22%\nServices (inc. \ndata centres)\n60%\n\n\n15\nNMRK.COM/UK\nNMRK.COM/UK\nThe South East and East\nPrime rent: typical achievable headline rent in \u00a3 per sq ft for units of good quality over 50,000 sq ft and let on a typical \n10-year lease to a tenant of strong covenant.\nPrime logistics rents\n\u00a310.50\npersq ft\n\u00a310.50\npersq ft\n\u00a312.50\npersq ft\n\u00a37.00\npersq ft\n\u00a39.00\npersq ft\n\u00a39.25\npersq ft\n\u00a310.25\npersq ft\n\u00a312.50\npersq ft\n\u00a39.00\npersq ft\n\u00a313.50\npersq ft\n\u00a310.50\npersq ft\n\u00a311.00\npersq ft\n\u00a315.50\npersq ft\n\u00a315.00\npersq ft\n\u00a318.50\npersq ft\n\u00a312.29\nper sq ft\n \nContact Mark Trowell for more information.\nContact Mark Trowell \nfor more information.\nQ3 2025 snapshot and 12-month outlook\nFALLING               STABLE              RISING\n\u00a311.65\n1.2m sq ft\n9.3%\n2.2m sq ft\n5.25%\nOccupier demand in the South East in Q3 was focused on cost-effective refurbished space, \nattracting a diverse mix of industries including logistics, furniture retail and automotive.

Whilst the first \nhalf of 2025 fell short of the volume during the same period last year, the data points to a \nsignificant improvement versus the last six months of 2024. Volatile sentiment and uncertainty \ncontinue to dominate much of the press coverage, however we are increasingly noticing a \nnumber of large businesses re-enter the market with active requirements and looking to \nonboard new space within their supply chains. To date we are yet to see any significant impact \nof the US tariff packages, so whilst many businesses are undoubtedly mitigating against the \nrelated downside risks, we\u2019re yet to see this impact significantly on the market. \nINDUSTRIAL STRATEGY, AND STRUCTURAL CHANGE\nJune 2025 marked an important month for the sector, as take-up continued to recover and \nmarket conditions continued to normalize. Perhaps more significantly the recent Government \npolicy announcements delivered through the UK Government\u2019s recent launch of both the \n\u201cModern Industrial Strategy 2025\u201d and \u201cUK Infrastructure: A 10 Year Strategy\u201d marks an \nimportant change of approach by the government. Both policies offer long-term upside for the \nsector. The creation of flexible funding packages, timed with sector specific plans and in excess \nof \u00a31.35bn in public funding to support economic growth now very specifically seeks to support \nthe sector and accelerate change. The transmission of these changes are unlikely to be fast and \nrequire significant planning, but we are hopeful in the short term these new strategies and \nframeworks may give businesses some confidence that the Government are keen to spur \ngrowth.\n.\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\nImproving volumes have been driven by \nreturning demand for larger 200,000 sq ft + \nwarehouses.\nRental growth fell to 3.5% year on year during \nQ2 2025, down from 3.7% during the previous \nquarter.\nInvestment volumes improved by 26% on Q1 \nnumbers rising to \u00a31.4bn, but trading remains \nmuted as pricing expectations widen slightly \nduring H1 2025.\nINSERT \nPICTURE\nRichard Evans\nInternational Partner\nHead of UK Logistics & Industrial\nrichard.evans@cushwake.com \n+44 (0) 7907 094 646\nCharles Howard\nPartner\nUK Logistics & Industrial Investment\ncharles.howard@cushwake.com \n+44 (0) 7810 631 409\nSignificant policy reform and recent industrial \nstrategy announcements improve long term \noutlook for the sector.\n\n\n3\nCushman & Wakefield\n\u00a9 2025 Cushman & Wakefield\nRETAIL SALES VOLUME & CONSUMER CONFIDENCE\nSUPPLY CHAIN PRESSURE INDEX\nECONOMIC INDICATORS\nSUPPLY CHAIN INDICATORS\nYOY\nChg\n12-Month \nForecast\nYOY\nChg\n12-Month \nForecast\n-0.06%\nRETAIL SALES \nVOLUMES\n-0.86%\nGVA T&S\n-0.6%\nGVA MANUFACTURING\n(Average weekly sales volumes NSA, GVA YoY \nChange)\n0.00\nSC PRESSURE INDEX\n103.5\nGOODS TRADE\nBAROMETER\n2,015\nBALTIC EXCH. DRY\nINDEX\nSource: ONS, MOODYS, NY FED, WTO \nMARKETBEAT\nQ2 2025\nLOGISTICS & INDUSTRIAL\nECONOMY :\nThe UK economy continues to endure market volatility, amidst ongoing \ngeopolitical pressures, improving yet fragile consumer market conditions, \nand re-surfacing inflationary pressures. During Q1 2025 GDP grew by 0.7%, \nwith subsequent monthly data pointing to a second consecutive contraction \nin May of 0.1% following the early 0.3% fall in April. Despite this versus the \nprevious 3 Month period aided by the carry-over from Q1\u2019s strong 0.7% gain. \nCPI rose to 3.6% in June, up from 3.4% in May, largely driven by stickiness in \ntransportation costs, and re-surfacing food inflation impacted by adverse \nweather and recent surges in production costs. The manufacturing PMI rose \nto 47.7 during June up from 46.4 in May, marking an improvement in \nsentiment and outlook across the sector despite remaining contractionary. \nConsumer market conditions continue to improve as households become \nmore confident in personal finances and the economic outlook, this saw the \nGFK consumer confidence index rise to -18, the highest levels since early \n2022, this also appears to be materialising into consumer spending.\nSUPPLY CHAIN:\nGlobal supply chain pressures remain below the elevated levels that were \nseen during 2021 and 2022, following a normalisation in conditions across \nthe key supply chain chokepoints (Suez Canal, Panama). During June 2025 \nthe Global Supply Chain Pressure Index (GSCPI) reached an index score of \n0.00 indicating neutral pressure. This comes following nearly a year of \nvolatility, having risen from the lows of early 2023. The imposition of the US \nliberation day tariff package continues to see many businesses frontloading \nand increasing inventories which has meant goods trade  is currently at \nelevated levels. The WTO Goods Trade Barometer reached 103.5 during July \nup from 102.8 well above trend levels. Elevated levels of trade has seen \ncontainer rates, and air freight rates increase sharply during late H2 as a \nresult. Red sea detours continue to affect lead times for many businesses, \nresulting in longer lead times by up to 14 days. \n-60\n-50\n-40\n-30\n-20\n-10\n0\n75\n85\n95\n105\n115\n125\n135\n2019\n2020\n2021\n2022\n2023\n2024\n2025\nRS Volume Index\nLS Consumer Confidence\n-2\n-1\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\nIndex Value\nLong Term Average\n\n\n\u00a9 2025 Cushman & Wakefield\n4\nMARK E TB E AT\nOCCUPIER\nQ2 2025\nTAKE-UP \nAVAILABILITY (BY GRADE)\nTAKE-UP:\nOccupier demand continued its recovery during the second quarter of 2025, with a total take-up volume of 8.8m \nsq ft representing an uplift of 10.5% versus the Q1 figure. This means total take-up during H1 2025 rose to 16.8m sq \nft a 32% increase on H2 2024. Improved take-up has been driven by a return in activity for big box units, most \nnotably for units of between 300,000 \u2013500,000 sq ft which contributed 3.4m sq ft of take up during the quarter. \nFollowing a period of muted retail sales volumes, and a relative absence from the market, Q2 also points towards \nincreasing activity from the 3PL sector with 10 deals being recorded, contributing a volume of 2.9m sq ft. \nInterestingly, whilst demand for speculatively developed space remains elevated, in recent months a number of \nGrade A deals have taken place within second hand units, accounting for 3.6m sq ft of the total space signed \nduring Q2.   \nSUPPLY:\nSupply increased by circa 7% during the quarter rising to just over 74m sq ft and returning availability to the \nhighest level since 2011. This increase comes as a result of a 10.5% increase in the volume of Grade B space available \nto occupiers, now standing at 17.4m sq ft, whilst Grade A supply increased by 6.5% now standing at 51.2m sq ft. In \nparticular, the increase was driven by a number of larger units coming to market, with Panattoni commencing the \nspeculative construction of circa 1.5m sq ft at its scheme in Swindon, whilst over 800,000 sq ft of second hand \nspace came to market in Central Scotland. Of the total availability 13.1m sq ft is available within units currently \nunder construction. This will add to a further 24.1m sq ft of space that has completed in recent years and remains \navailable.\nDEVELOPMENT:\nDevelopment activity remains at lower levels than the market had seen in recent years, with the pipeline \ncontracting in 2024 relative to the highs of 2022 and 2023. Of the near 11m sq ft of space that completed during \nthis period aproximately 10m sq ft remains vacant. New starts during 2025 so far remain modest, with just 1.65m sq \nft starting during the last quarter in line with the Q1 2025, and notable a reduction on the 2.6m sq ft that started \nconstruction during Q2 2024. Despite the drop off in activity, we continue to monitor a number of announcements \nand planning decisions which point to sustained activity within the development market. At present we anticipate \nthat speculative development completions during 2026 will be in the region of 12.5m \u2013 14m sq ft, a higher level than \nduring 2025.\nRENTAL GROWTH:\nRental growth continues at lower levels than in previous years, and has reduced quarter on quarter. For mid-box \nproperties year on year rental growth has fallen to 3.3% based on the average UK rent, whilst for big box average \nyear on year rental growth contracted marginally to 3.7%. The slowing comes as a result of lower levels of \ntransactional evidence in recent quarters, and a structural increase in the levels of supply within the market. We \nanticipate that owed to improving market fundamentals, and a number of key bell-weather deals, that the rental \ngrowth outlook remains stable, with the potential for upside during the second half of the year.\nC&W PRIME AVERAGE RENT INDEX\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025\nMillions sq ft\nQ1\nQ2\nQ3\nQ4\n5 Year Pre Pandemic H1 Average\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n2012\n2013\n2014\n2015\n2016\n2017\n2018\n2019\n2020\n2021\n2022\n2023\n2024\nQ2 2025\nMillions sq ft\nGrade A\nGrade B\nGrade C\n0%\n5%\n10%\n15%\n20%\n25%\n80\n100\n120\n140\n160\n180\n200\nYoY 100K + (RHS)\n50-100k sizeband\n100k Sizeband\n\n\n\u00a9 2025 Cushman & Wakefield\n5\nMARK E TB E AT\nINVESTMENT \nQ2 2025\nINVESTMENT VOLUMES (\u00a3BN)\nNUMBER OF DEALS BY LOT SIZE\nINVESTMENT VOLUMES: \nInvestment activity improved marginally during the second quarter of 2025, with a total investment volume of \n\u00a31.4bn representing a 26% improvement versus Q1. Despite the recent improvement, investment volumes \nremain structurally lower than in previous market phases falling 21% below the 5 year pre-pandemic Q2 average. \nThe reduction in activity levels is largely attributable to continued uncertainty within financial markets, which \nhaving seen early volatility in bond market, were then impacted by the Liberation Day Tariff announcements \nand UK budget. This has led some sellers to pause on assets sales being bought to market, assessing price \naspirations relative to the volatile back drop.\nImprovement was driven by an increase in activity for larger portfolios, with a total volume of \u00a3613m, nearly \nthree times the volume recorded during the first quarter. Meanwhile for single asset deals Q2 was typified by a \nshift towards smaller lot sizes, which saw a total of 52 deals recorded during the quarter, up from 37 during the \nfirst quarter, but negatively impacting the total investment volume. \nFor core and core plus investors activity continues to focus on prime markets with the South East and North \nWest continuing to attract significant capital during the first 6 months of 2025. Deal activity has become more \nsporadic for value add and opportunistic investors, with investment decisions driven to a greater degree by \nlocal market and submarket level dynamics.\nYIELDS & PRICING:\nLower investment volumes and volatility within financial markets has driven a greater spread in both pricing \nexpectations and deal outcomes during the first six months of 2025. However, a lack of readily available prime \nsupply and continued investor conviction around the sector has helped to support prime pricing resulting in \nconsistent stabilised yields for best-in-class facilities. The average prime yield across the 71 submarkets tracked \nby C&W remained at 5.35% for a third consecutive quarter, having contracted most recently by 5BPS in \nSeptember 2024 as a result of small corrections in secondary and peripheral locations.\nWhilst sentiment remains robust for most investors, a degree of caution persists. Although occupational market \nconditions have improved, many remain aware of lingering down-side risk largely attributable to \nmacroeconomic conditions. From a market perspective rental growth remains relatively stable albeit at lower \nlevels than investors have enjoyed in recent years, and this, combined with a degree of stability and improved \nsentiment, may help to support contraction later in the year. Undoubtedly many within the market will look to \nmonitor re-surfacing inflationary pressures, with many market commentators now reversing expectations of \ntwo or three cuts to a single November cut.\nPRIME YIELD BY TYPE\n -\n 10\n 20\n 30\n 40\n 50\n 60\n 70\n\u00a310-25m\n\u00a325-50m\n\u00a350-75m\n\u00a375m+\nQ2 2025\nQ2 2024\nQ2 2023\n3%\n4%\n4%\n5%\n5%\n6%\n6%\n7%\n7%\n8%\n2012\n2012\n2013\n2013\n2014\n2014\n2015\n2015\n2016\n2016\n2017\n2017\n2018\n2018\n2019\n2019\n2020\n2020\n2021\n2021\n2022\n2022\n2023\n2023\n2024\n2024\n2025\nUK Headline\nUK Average\n -\n 2\n 4\n 6\n 8\n 10\n 12\n 14\n 16\n 18\n 20\n2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025\nQ1\nQ2\nQ3\nQ4\nH1 5 Year Pre Pandemic Average\n\n\n\u00a9 2025 Cushman & Wakefield\n6\nMARK E TB E AT\nREGIONAL OUTLOOK\nQ2 2025\nNorth West\nDemand remains robust in the North West having seen 17 deals complete during the first \nhalf of 2025.

The robustness of the latest market \ndata has helped to validate the quiet optimism and improving sentiment that many of us have \nbeen sensing over the past 6 to 9 months. Much of the recent activity is being driven by \noccupier groups returning to the market, many of whom appear to be reactivating strategic \nsupply chain plans that were previously paused. On the supply side, conditions are beginning to \nstabilise, and the measured pace of development seen in recent months should provide a \nsupportive backdrop for rental growth across the sector as we move into 2026.\nA CHANGING ECONOMIC PICTURE\nDespite the market being set to benefit from a number of recent policy announcements \nincluding the new Industrial Strategy, and strategic defence sector plan, caution persists around \nthe bigger picture. Although growth remains relatively strong and September's inflation data \npoints to stabilisation across key categories anticipation of the forthcoming Autumn Budget will \nlikely dampen activity during Q4. An expected increase in tax will add further to cost pressures \noccupiers have had to absorb in recent years. However, robust demand throughout 2025 and \nimproving activity across all occupier groups may potentially point to a detachment between \nsupply chain decision making and the lingering economic uncertainty.\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\nReturning big box demand, particularly from \nfood retailers and the 3PL sector, helps to drive \nimprovement across major markets.\nBig box rental growth slowed to 3.6% from 3.9% \ndespite uptick in levels of take-up.\nInvestment volumes improved to \u00a31.75bn during \nQ3 but despite recovery remain significantly \nbelow long-term average with volumes in 2025 \nmuted.\nINSERT \nPICTURE\nRichard Evans\nInternational Partner\nHead of UK Logistics & Industrial\nrichard.evans@cushwake.com \n+44 (0) 7907 094 646\nCharles Howard\nPartner\nUK Logistics & Industrial Investment\ncharles.howard@cushwake.com \n+44 (0) 7810 631 409\nEconomic outlook continues to evolve with \nincreasing down-side risk, and concern around \nthe forthcoming Autumn Budget in November.\n\n\n3\nCushman & Wakefield\n\u00a9 2025 Cushman & Wakefield\nRETAIL SALES VOLUME & CONSUMER CONFIDENCE\nSUPPLY CHAIN PRESSURE INDEX\nECONOMIC INDICATORS\nSUPPLY CHAIN INDICATORS\nYOY\nChg\n12-Month \nForecast\nYOY\nChg\n12-Month \nForecast\n+0.51%\nRETAIL SALES \nVOLUMES\n+3.85%\nGVA T&S\n-0.93%\nGVA MANUFACTURING\n(Average weekly sales volumes NSA, GVA YoY \nChange)\n0.03\nSC PRESSURE INDEX\n103.5\nGOODS TRADE\nBAROMETER\n2,057\nBALTIC EXCH.

Some positivity is to be \ntaken in the short term from the latest indicators. Monthly GDP returned \nto positive territory in August and inflation data for September showed a \ndegree of stability with CPI once again measuring in at 3.8%. Anticipation \nof tax rises in the forthcoming Autumn Budget are weakening sentiment, \nwith the composite PMI falling to a barely expansionary score of 50.1, the \nmanufacturing PMI sliding further to a contractionary score of 46.2 and \nconsumer confidence worsening by two points to -19. Whilst sentiment \noften over-shoots real market conditions, the latest indicators may point \nto a softer economic environment and slowing recovery as we enter 2026. \nShould inflation remain sticky, and tax rises be included within the next \nbudget we may once again be faced with increasing levels of deal friction, \nand slower occupier take-up.\n \nSUPPLY CHAIN:\nSupply chain pressures have continued to trend upwards in recent months \nas a result of elevated international trade tensions, ongoing capacity \nconstraints along key chokepoints, and resurfacing inflationary pressures. \nThe GSCPI rose to a score of 0.03 from -0.04 during August, undoing \nsome of the recovery seen since May, and rising above the 24 month \naverage. Despite the short term increase, this score remains below that of \nSeptember 2024. Whilst these factors continue to induce friction and \ndelays, it's generally felt that these are yet to become severe enough to \nde-stabilise the normalisation that has been enjoyed in the post covid \nyears. Retailers and manufacturers are continuing to proactively reduce \nsupply chain risks increasingly turning to nearshoring and multi-sourcing \nstrategies which continues to support sector trends such as re-shoring, \nand higher inventory levels.\n-60\n-50\n-40\n-30\n-20\n-10\n0\n75\n85\n95\n105\n115\n125\n135\n2019\n2020\n2021\n2022\n2023\n2024\n2025\nRS Volume Index\nLS Consumer Confidence\n-2\n-1\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n31-Jan-2015\n30-Apr-2015\n31-Jul-2015\n31-Oct-2015\n31-Jan-2016\n30-Apr-2016\n31-Jul-2016\n31-Oct-2016\n31-Jan-2017\n30-Apr-2017\n31-Jul-2017\n31-Oct-2017\n31-Jan-2018\n30-Apr-2018\n31-Jul-2018\n31-Oct-2018\n31-Jan-2019\n30-Apr-2019\n31-Jul-2019\n31-Oct-2019\n31-Jan-2020\n30-Apr-2020\n31-Jul-2020\n31-Oct-2020\n31-Jan-2021\n30-Apr-2021\n31-Jul-2021\n31-Oct-2021\n31-Jan-2022\n30-Apr-2022\n31-Jul-2022\n31-Oct-2022\n31-Jan-2023\n30-Apr-2023\n31-Jul-2023\n31-Oct-2023\n31-Jan-2024\n30-Apr-2024\n31-Jul-2024\n31-Oct-2024\n31-Jan-2025\n30-Apr-2025\n31-Jul-2025\n\n\n\u00a9 2025 Cushman & Wakefield\n4\nMARK E TB E AT\nOCCUPIER\nQ3 2025\nTAKE-UP \nAVAILABILITY (BY GRADE)\nTAKE-UP: Occupier demand reached its highest level since Q2 2022, with over 12.2m sq ft of space signed for across \n64 deals. Such improvement represents a 35% increase on the Q2 volume and now means that occupier activity \nthroughout 2025 sits 11% ahead of the volume recorded at this point last year. Recovery has been most felt within \nthe big box market which is now 16% ahead of where it had been 12 months prior. This is being driven by returning \ndemand from both the manufacturing and retail sectors which accounted for over 50% of take-up during the \nquarter. The food retail sector remains a key proponent of demand with over 2.3m sq ft of space signed for over 3 \ndeals by the major supermarkets, their return contributing to the highest level of retail demand since 2018. Although \ndemand continues to focus on modern highly specified space, with 8.7m sq ft (71%) of the quarterly take-up \naccounted for by grade A buildings, demand for grade B space also remains healthy, with 2.75m sq ft signed for \nduring Q3.\nSUPPLY: Supply contracted by 4% during the third quarter of 2025, a modest contraction when considering the \nsizeable quarterly take-up figure. The contraction has been predominantly driven by the combination of a slow down \nin the volume of Grade A space returning to market and lower levels of speculative development. Grade A supply fell \nby 6% to 48.5m sq ft from 51.7m sq ft. Over the last 12 months, the supply of secondhand space has increased, with \n34.4m sq ft available within existing buildings, up from 28.3m sq ft at the end of Q3 2024. Despite seemingly \nbuoyant demand the supply of Grade B space remains elevated relative to recent years, increasing by 3% quarter on \nquarter. The supply of mid box space remains healthy, with 16m sq ft currently available of which 7.2m sq ft is under \nconstruction or has recently completed. The level of supply under offer remains healthy with circa 9m sq ft of space \nacross 58 buildings currently under offer.\nDEVELOPMENT: Development activity remains subdued following a significant tranche of activity in recent years. \nNew starts fell to circa 900,000 sq ft during the quarter, well below the 6m sq ft recorded at the peak in Q1 2023. \nThis comes as a considerable proportion of previous years development remains vacant upon completion, and the \ndevelopment market pauses to reflect on the recalibration in market dynamics seen over the last 12 months. During \n2025 8.9m sq ft has been delivered so far, with 7.3m sq ft remaining vacant, a further 3.3m sq ft remains under \nconstruction with practical completion anticipated before year end. Notably a number of large speculative units \nremain under construction with five units over 500,000 sq ft currently available. Should timelines be met and delays \navoided 2025 will see 12.3m sq ft of speculative space delivered to market, an increase on the 10.1m sq ft recorded \nlast year.\nRENTAL GROWTH: Rental growth remains modest across the UK with our data pointing to a growing spread across \nthe regions, this comes as pockets of sustained rental growth in prime markets and at key schemes contrast against \nthe broadly slowing or stable levels of rental growth seen nationally. The Mid Box market recorded average annual \nrental growth of 4.3% at the end of Q3, with growth driven by pockets of under-supply and new benchmark deals in \nsome markets. This represents an improvement on the Q2 figure that saw an average of 3.4% across the 71 markets \ntracked by C&W. The big box market saw average annual rental growth of 3.6% at the end of Q3 slightly down on \nthe 3.9% recorded last quarter, and reflective of slightly elevated levels of supply, and a preference towards second \nhand value stock by occupiers.\nC&W PRIME AVERAGE RENT INDEX\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025\nMillions\nQ1\nQ2\nQ3\nQ4\nQ1 - Q3 5 Year Pre Pandemic Average\n -\n 0\n 0\n 1\n 1\n 1\n 1\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n2012\n2013\n2014\n2015\n2016\n2017\n2018\n2019\n2020\n2021\n2022\n2023\n2024\nQ3 2025\nMillions\nGrade A\nGrade B\nGrade C\n0%\n5%\n10%\n15%\n20%\n25%\n80\n100\n120\n140\n160\n180\n200\nYoY 100K + (RHS)\n50-100k sizeband\n100k Sizeband\n\n\n\u00a9 2025 Cushman & Wakefield\n5\nMARK E TB E AT\nINVESTMENT \nQ3 2025\nINVESTMENT VOLUMES (\u00a3BN)\nNUMBER OF DEALS BY LOT SIZE\nINVESTMENT VOLUMES:  \nDespite a second consecutive quarter of recovery with \u00a31.75bn transacting during Q3, investment volumes \nremain subdued as investors continue to grapple with tough macroeconomic conditions and a spread in pricing \naspirations. The quarterly figure represents a 28% improvement relative to the volume recorded during Q2, but \na fall of 10% below the 5 year pre-pandemic Q3 average. This takes total investment to \u00a34.3bn during 2025, 14% \nbelow the volume recorded through the first 9 months of 2024, and 26% below the 5 year pre-pandemic Q1-Q3 \naverage.\nRecovery was driven by growth in the single asset market, accounting for 72 of the 78 deals that took place \nduring the quarter, and notching a 60% uplift relative to Q2. Activity remains relatively limited to low-medium \nlot sizes, as a result of limited prime big box logistics supply. As a result, investment for lot sizes between \u00a310-\n25m almost doubled during the quarter. Portfolio transactions fell from \u00a3613m across 7 deals to just \u00a3460m \nacross 6 deals and included just two large portfolios with a value in excess of \u00a3150m. We estimate that \napproximately \u00a33bn of assets remains under offer, potentially indicating improvement during Q4 and early \n2026.\nDespite a wealth of capital targeting the sector, investors seeking to deploy face challenges in identifying, \npricing, and executing at present. This is being driven by patchy levels of supply, particularly of prime best in \nclass space, as vendors are now seemingly looking to extend their hold periods in expectation of improving \nmarket conditions. It is felt that liquidity will return to the market following the November budget, as the market \nlooks to re-gain some degree of certainty around the macroeconomic picture.\nYIELDS & PRICING:\nThe pricing of prime Logistics and Industrial assets softened during Q3 2025, reflective of subdued market \nconditions. The combination of limited prime market evidence and a lack of competitive tension within the \nbidding process has seen average prime yields move out by circa 11 BPS. The average prime yield across the 71 \nmarkets tracked by C&W now stands at circa 5.5% having shifted out from 5.35% at the end of Q2, whilst the \nheadline yield softened by 25BPS to 4.85% at the end of Q3.\nMarket uncertainty over the last 12 months has led to more muted views on the market recovery timelines.  \nHowever, the sector continues to present attractive fundamentals alongside an improving occupier market \noutlook. A degree of certainty, or at least visibility over the autumn budget and its implications for markets, is \nlikely to improve investor conviction and present clarity in investor strategy as we enter 2026.

Industrial & Logistics Insider Q3 2025\nResearch\n11.11.2025\nIndustrial & Logistics Insider Q3 2025\n[image]\n\u2022  Q3 Investment Tops 10-Year Average\n\u2022  Investors See Value In Under-Rented Warehouses\n\u2022  Q3 2025 Demand Hits 3-Year High\n\u2022  Occupiers Seek Value Across Regions\n\u2022  Speculative Development Rises Slowly\nQ3 Investment Tops 10-Year Average\nIndustrial investment volume in the third quarter of 2025 reached\n\u00a32.9bn, which represents a 13% increase on Q3 last year and a 14%\nincrease on the Q3 10-year average. This brings the annual total to\n\u00a38.6bn, up 16% y/y \u2013 if we see a repeat of last year\u2019s Q4 investment\nvolume this year, annual industrial investment activity will exceed\nthe 10-year average. The rolling annual investment volume in the\nsector exceeds \u00a312bn \u2013 the highest four-quarter total since Q4 2022.\nEven so, individual deal count remains relatively low by historic\nstandards, with portfolio and merger & acquisition (M&A)\ntransactions continuing to drive investment volume.\n\n\n\u00a0\nInvestors See Value In Under-Rented\nWarehouses\nThis is particularly evident in smaller units on multi-let estates. In\ntheir Q3 trading update, SEGRO, who manage a number of prime\nurban logistics assets in and around London, announced a 49%\nreversion capture this year to date at rent reviews, which gives an\nidea of the potential reversion still on offer, even as headline ERV\ngrowth moderates.\n\u00a0\nQ3 2025 Demand Hits 3-Year High\nThe third quarter of 2025 was marked by a strong annual rise in\ndemand for the industrial & logistics sector, driven by built-to-suit\ndeals and occupier desire for new units which meet their\nrequirements. These occupier-specific developments can help to\nexplain why existing supply has not dropped despite an increase in\ndemand relative to recent years.\n\u00a0\nOccupiers Seek Value Across Regions\nWhile half of take-up was located in the Midlands, there is some\nsuggestion that occupiers are seeking value outside of the golden\ntriangle. Previous quarters this year have seen demand for both the\nSouth West and Yorkshire outstrip their 5-year averages. This\nquarter, the North and the East of England, as well as Scotland,\nhave seen elevated demand. UK manufacturer Regency Glass have\nset a record rent in the North West, taking 420,000 sq ft at\nIndurent\u2019s Omega West, and in the North East Pyrol have taken c.\n390,000 sq ft second-hand space. The Ministry of Defence have\ntaken 200,000 sq ft at Westway 200 in Glasgow, the largest spec\ndeal in Scotland over the last 30 years.\n\n\n\u00a0\nSpeculative Development Rises Slowly\nThere is 3.7m sq ft big box space currently being developed across\nthe UK which is expected to reach project completion in the final\nquarter of the year. Much of this is concentrated around Tritax Big\nBox\u2019s Symmetry Park in Biggleswade, as well as the Panattoni\nmega-box development in Doncaster, comprising of 770,000 sq ft. A\ntotal of 7.9m sq ft is under construction to be completed before the\nend of 2026 centred around the South East and Midlands.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTo read the full report, download the PDF.\nSubscribe to the latest market updates\nand reports\nReceive our market analysis, news, and data from our\nResearch team, straight to your inbox.\nExplore the insights and reports available to you or\nupdate your preferences by subscribing today.\nYou must have JavaScript enabled to use this form.\nBy ticking this box,\u00a0you\u00a0consent\u00a0to receive\ncommercial\u00a0communications\u00a0or offers for goods and services from\nBNP Paribas Real Estate.\nBy providing this information to BNP Paribas Real Estate, you agree\nthat BNP Paribas Real Estate may handle the information as set out\nin their\u00a0Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.\nSubscribe[image]\n\n\nI'll do it later\nRead the Full Report\nDownload\nEoghan Morgan\nAssociate Director, Research\nCharlie Tattersall\nSenior Associate Director\n[image]\nContact the author\nShare this article\n\u2022  \n\u2022  twitter\nReal Estate for a changing world\nFooter menu\n\u2022  [image]\n\u2022  BNP PARIBAS REAL ESTATE\n\u25cb  Find a Property\n\u25cb  Insights\n\u25cb  Contact us\n\u25cb  Client Money Protection\n\u25cb  Know Your Customer\n\u25cb  Making a complaint\n\u25cb  Property Index\n\u25cb  Whistleblowing\n\u2022  ABOUT US\n\u25cb  Who we are\n\u25cb  Our Work\n\u25cb  Our Campaigns\n\u25cb  Our Executive Team\n\u25cb  Diversity and Inclusion\n\u25cb  Corporate Responsibility\n\u25cb  Modern Slavery Statement\n\u25cb  COVID-19 Policy Statement\n\n\n\u25cb  UK Tax Strategy\n\u25cb  Carbon Reduction Plan\n\u2022  NEWS & EVENTS\n\u25cb  News\n\u25cb  Events\n\u25cb  Media Center\n\u2022  CAREERS\n\u25cb  Working with us\n\u25cb  Find a Job\n\u25cb  Early Careers\n\u2022  CONTACT US\n\u25cb  Contact Us\n\u25cb  Strutt & Parker\n\u25cb  John Clegg & Co\n\u25cb  Real Estate Group\n\u25cb  LinkedIn\n\u25cb  Twitter\n\u2022  LinkedIn\n\u2022  Twitter\nBottom bar\n\u2022  BNP Paribas Real Estate\n\u2022  BNP Paribas Group\n\u2022  Data Protection Notice\n\u2022  Cookie Policy\n\u2022  Terms of Use\n\u2022  Site map\n\u2022  \u00a9 BNP PARIBAS REAL ESTATE\nWe have a host of experts available for you to message with any\nquestions you might have.\n\n\nI would like to speak to someone about:\nContact the team\n Send[image]\nBy ticking this box,\u00a0you\u00a0consent\u00a0to receive\ncommercial\u00a0communications\u00a0or offers for goods and services from\nBNP Paribas Real Estate.\nBy providing this information to BNP Paribas Real Estate, you agree\nthat BNP Paribas Real Estate may handle the information as set out\nin their\u00a0Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.\nYou must have JavaScript enabled to use this form.\nFurther information\nWhenever you visit our website and/or use its features such\nas\u00a0web\u00a0forms, BNP Paribas Real Estate processes information\u00a0about\nyou\u00a0such as personal identifying data including contact details for\nthe purpose of processing the requests that are sent to us via the\nwebsite, and, in some cases, for marketing purposes\u00a0including\u00a0by\nusing cookies.

This year,\nsecondary rental growth will continue to lag prime, with the\ndiscount to new-builds rising to another new high.\nLSH says the strong emphasis on quality will remain a key theme\nthrough 2025, with take-up for the year expected to end up broadly\nin line with the pre-pandemic average at around 40m sq ft. In 2024,\ntake-up totalled 39.3m sq ft, driven by a resilient Midlands market\nand Q4 delivering the best quarterly performance since 2023,\nboosted by major commitments from Amazon, Frasers Group and\nB&M.\nRental growth, which has played a key role in driving investor\ndemand, looks set to continue, as occupiers focus on quality.\nAverage prime rental growth across the UK\u2019s key markets was 4.6%\nin 2024 and prime rents are predicted to grow by around 4% in\n2025. However, growth will be geographically patchier and may be\noffset by more generous incentives, says LSH.\n\n\n2024 ended strongly for investment into the sector, with volume of\n\u00a32.7bn in Q4 driving the annual total to \u00a38.2bn, the fourth\nstrongest year on record. Industrial and logistics accounted for 33%\nof the combined volume of investment across the UK\u2019s three core\ncommercial sectors in 2024, significantly ahead of the long-run\nannual average of 19%. The total volume of investment into the\nsector also ran ahead of offices for the first time in history in 2024,\nreflecting comparatively weak investor sentiment in the latter.\nLSH says 2025 promises more of the same, with overseas capital\nready to be deployed from a mix of existing and new market\nentrants. It forecasts total returns of 8.4% per annum between 2025\nand 2028, putting it ahead of all other core property sectors.\nAlex Carr, Executive Director \u2013 National Head of Industrial\nInvestment at LSH, said:\u00a0\u201cSet against a difficult backdrop,\u00a0yet\nagain industrial and logistics was the top-performing asset class for\n2024, and we expect this to continue into 2025.\u00a0There has also been\na big increase in M&A activity, which we predict will provide\nadditional stock to the market. Looking ahead, we may anticipate\nsome modest prime yield compression later in the year and a\ncontinued narrowing of the bid/ask spread.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\nTotal overseas purchases amounted to \u00a34.4bn in 2024, with net\npurchases standing 55% higher than in 2023, at \u00a33.4bn.\nInternational investors remain dominant at the larger end of the\nmarket, striking 16 of 2024\u2019s largest 20 deals, and North America\ndominated once again, accounting for three-quarters of overseas\ninflows. 2025 promises to be no different, says LSH, with overseas\ninflows forecast to account for approximately 60% of volume for\nthe year.\nMeanwhile, supply levels have recovered steadily over the past two\nyears, with the UK availability rate ticking up from 5.9% to 7.0%\nduring 2024, equivalent to 1.5 years of average take-up. However,\nrelatively cautious appetite for speculative development will help to\nkeep a lid on supply, with a modest 7.6m sq ft of development\nstarting in 2025, the lowest annual total since 2014. Overall, the UK\navailability rate is forecast to rise to 7.6% by the end of 2025,\nbefore peaking at circa 8% in 2026.\n\n\nJames Polson, Executive Director \u2013 National Head of Industrial\nand Logistics at LSH, said: \u201c2024 was a challenging year for\noccupiers, which was expected due to the sluggishness of the\neconomy and rising operating costs. But necessity is the mother of\ninvention \u2013 our clients need to innovate and drive efficiencies to\nhelp drive demand. We have seen this for example with Evri and\ntheir ongoing estates management and acquisition programme.\nRichard Meering, Senior Director \u2013 National Head of Industrial\nLeasing at LSH, said:\u00a0\u201c2024 proved to be tough, but there are signs\nof life returning to the market and we are cautiously optimistic that\na better year is in store for 2025. Despite challenges relating to the\npolitical environment and increasing competition between sites for\npower, fundamentals remain sound. The sector and its diverse parts\n\u2013 data centres, logistics, high-end e-commerce \u2013 remain a very\nphysical reminder of all that is good in the UK economy. Those that\ncan keep the faith in this outlook, and stay the course, will find\nplenty of opportunity as we traverse 2025.\u201d\u00a0\nDownload the Industrial & Logistics Market Report 2025 in full\nhere\u00a0\u2192\nRelated Content\n[image]\nBudget Brake: Q3 Property Investment Held Back by Uncertainty\nResearch UK property investment totalled \u00a38.8bn in Q3, repeating\nQ2\u2019s subdued volume\n[image]\nStandstill: UK Property Investment Slips to Two-Year Low Research\nThe UK investment market stood still in Q2, repeating the subdued\npattern of the prev...\n[image]\nUKIT Q1 2025: Property Investment Down But Not Out In Q1\nResearch\n[image]\nUKIT Q4 2024: Q4 Caps Year of Extremes for UK Investment Market\nResearch\n[image]\n\n\nUKIT Q3 2024: Resurgent Retail Buying Drives Q3 Investment\nResearch\n[image]\nUKIT Q2 2024: All Change Research Living Drives Improved\nInvestment in Q2\nView all content\nGet in touch\n[image]\nJames Polson\nExecutive Director - National Head of Industrial and Logistics\n0207 198 2000\nEmail me direct\n[image]\nRichard Meering\nSenior Director - National Head of Industrial Leasing\n0207 198 2000\nEmail me direct\n[image]\nAlex Carr\nExecutive Director - National Head of Industrial Investment\n020 7198 2000\nEmail me direct\n[image]\nOliver du Sautoy\n\n\nSenior Director - Head of Research\n020 7198 2000\nEmail me direct\nEmail me direct\nTo:\nSubject:\nMy email address*:\nMessage*:\nSend me a copy of this email\nPlease note all fields marked as (*) are mandatory\nSend now\nREGISTER FOR UPDATES\nGet the latest insight, event invites and commercial properties by\nemail\nSign up\nGet in touch\nName*:\nCompany:\nEmail*:\nTel no:\nMessage:\nI would like email alerts on relevant research and advice\n\n\nPlease note all fields marked as (*) are mandatory\nSend now\n020 7198 2000\nmarketing@lsh.co.uk\n\u2022  Commercial property search\n\u2022  Our people\n\u2022  Offices\n\u2022  Research\n\u2022  Register\n[image]\n\u00a9 2026 Lambert Smith Hampton | Regulated by RICS | Terms of\nuse | Cookies Policy | Complaints | Slavery Statement | Gender Pay\nGap | Client Money Protection | Property Index A-Z | Privacy Policy\n| Procurement Policy & Supplier Code of Conduct\n[image]\nHow can we help?\nClose form\nClose\n\n\n",

Investors continue to favour the sector due to\n\n\nsectoral tailwinds, and with pricing now showing signs of\nimprovement, robust prospects for rental growth, and reduced\nborrowing costs, 2025 should see stronger levels of investment\nactivity, particularly from investors focused on core assets.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Modest Yield Compression\nAs borrowing costs fall and gilt yields compress, we expect some\nmodest yield compression. Prime London industrial estates\u2019\nequivalent yields are now back below 5.00%, with two recent\ntransactions evidencing pricing at around 4.75%.\nTen-year gilts are forecast to fall next year (and beyond), which\nshould put downward pressure on real estate yields. Oxford\nEconomics forecasts ten-year government bonds to yield 4.16% by\nthe end of 2025, reducing further in 2026/27. This compares with\n4.29% at present. If inflation falls more quickly than expected, gilt\nyields could compress further, enabling more significant yield\ncompression for industrial property. Conversely, there are downside\nrisks to the forecast\u2014an increase in trade tariffs would prove\ninflationary and could mean gilt yields and property yields remain\nelevated.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Rental Growth Will Continue to\nSlow\nThe pace of rental growth has been slowing since peaking in 2022.\nIn August 2022, the MSCI monthly index registered average annual\nrental growth of 13.2%. The latest reading is 6.1% (year to the end\nof October). RealFor forecasts average annual rental growth for the\nUK at 5.5% for the 2024 calendar year, slowing to 3.7% in 2025.\nAlthough rental growth is slowing in the industrial sector,\nexpectations far exceed those for other sectors, with 2.4% average\nrental growth forecast for UK offices next year (RealFor).\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Occupier Market to Remain\nStable\n\n\nOccupier demand in 2025 will remain broadly consistent with the\nlevels seen this year.\nThe UK\u2019s occupier market is highly diverse and, as such, demand\nfor space has a relatively broad base. However, different segments\nof the occupier market have different drivers and move at different\nspeeds. We will see some shifts in the types of demand and the\nlocation preferences of occupiers as a result.\nThe occupier market remains supported by strong fundamentals,\nincluding continued expansion of the e-commerce market and\nongoing risks to international supply chains, which are prompting\nincreased use of local suppliers or a need to hold additional stock.\nThese trends continue to drive expansion prospects for the medium\nto long term. However, in the near term, most operators will face\nrising operating costs in 2025, with energy and labour costs both\nset to rise. This may prompt some firms to put their business\nexpansion plans on hold.\nAs operators grapple with rising costs, we may continue to see cases\nof business restructurings and bankruptcies. However, for some\noperators, these increasing costs will boost appetite for automation\nand efficiency improvements. In some cases, implementing these\nimprovements may require upgrading their facilities.\nAn improving economic picture, with rising real wages, should\nprovide a boost to retail sales volumes. Oxford Economics forecasts\n1.8% growth next year. However, unemployment is also anticipated\nto rise, and this, coupled with weaker consumer confidence, could\nundermine expectations for growth.\nWe will see 3PLs more active in the market. After muted activity\npost-pandemic, there are currently several sizable 3PL\nrequirements. Demand from this segment of the market will, in\npart, be driven by expansion in retail demand, as well as the drive\nfor efficiencies, ongoing supply chain threats, and the desire to\noutsource supply chain operations where risks are high, and\nmargins are low.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Vacancy Rate Will Top Out\n\n\nThe vacancy rate has been rising since 2022. It was 3.3% at the end\nof 2022, rising to 5.5% at the end of 2023, with the latest Q3 2024\nfigure at 7.2%. The rate at which it is increasing has started to slow.\nWhile we expect it to increase further, we anticipate it will top out\nin 2025 before starting to moderate.\nDevelopment activity has been slowing. In 2022, 37 million sq ft of\nspace was completed; this fell to 33 million sq ft in 2023, and we\nexpect just over 20 million sq ft to complete this year. As a result of\nslowing development activity, the amount of speculative space\ndelivered to the market vacant will moderate.\nWhile development completions are contributing to vacancy in\nsome markets, most of the space currently available is second-hand.\nDuring the pandemic, some e-commerce retailers overexpanded.\nThe rapid upscaling in operations led to heightened demand (either\nthrough direct leases or 3PL contracts), particularly for new, best-\nin-class XL warehouse buildings, following a period of \u201cright-\nsizing\u201d, some of these facilities are now fitted out and available.\nThe availability of modern, second-hand space will appeal to many\noccupiers, particularly those motivated to move and save on fit-out\ncosts.\u00a0\nPrevious article Iberian outperformers shrug off European economic\nuncertainty\nNext article The Retail Note | Retail: Back in the Game\nTags: Logistics & Industrial Spotlights Occupiers Regular Updates\nUK occupiers\n\u2022  Property Sectors\n\u25cb  Agriculture\n\u25cb  Healthcare\n\u25cb  Hotels\n\u25cb  Industrial\n\u25cb  Land\n\u25cb  Offices\n\u25cb  Residential Lettings\n\n\n\u25cb  Residential Sales\n\u25cb  Retail\n\u25cb  Data Centres\n\u2022  Topics\n\u25cb  Brexit\n\u25cb  Covid-19\n\u25cb  Cities\n\u25cb  ESG\n\u25cb  Economics\n\u25cb  Luxury Investment\n\u25cb  Next Neighbourhoods\n\u25cb  Wealth\n\u2022  Publications\n\u25cb  Active Capital\n\u25cb  Africa Horizons\n\u25cb  Global Buyers Survey\n\u25cb  Global Development Report\n\u25cb  London Series\n\u25cb  Rural Report\n\u25cb  Singapore View\n\u25cb  The Wealth Report\n\u25cb  Ski Report\n\u2022  World Regions\n\u25cb  Africa\n\u25cb  Asia-Pacific\n\u25cb  Europe\n\u25cb  Global\n\u25cb  Middle East\n\u25cb  North Americas\n\u2022  About Knight Frank\n\u25cb  Residential Services\n\n\n\u25cb  Occupier Services\n\u25cb  Capital Markets\n\u25cb  Valuations\n\u25cb  Our App\n\u25cb  Contact Us\n\u25cb  Subscribe\n\u25cb  RICS Client Money Protection Certificate\n\u25cb  Redress scheme details\n\u25cb  Client Money Handling Procedures\n[image]\nSTAY CONNECTED\n\u2022  Sign up for research updates\n\u2022  \n\u2022  \n\u2022  \n\u2022  \n\u2022  \n\u2022  \n\u2022  Group Privacy Statement | Modern Slavery Act\nCopyright \u00a9 Knight Frank.\nThe Intelligence Lab\n\u2022  Key Topics\nBack\nKey Topics\nTrending Now\n\u25cb  Economics\n\u25cb  ESG\n\u25cb  Luxury Investment\n\n\n\u25cb  Wealth\n\u25cb  Forecast\n\u25cb  The House View\n\u25cb  Podcast\n\u2022  Sectors\nBack\nSectors\nMain sectors\n\u25cb  Agriculture\n\u25cb  Development\n\u25cb  Industrial\n\u25cb  Land\n\u25cb  Logistics\n\u25cb  Offices\n\u25cb  Residential Lettings\n\u25cb  Residential Sales\n\u25cb  Retail\n\u25cb  UK Country Homes\nSpecialist\n\u25cb  Healthcare\n\u25cb  Hotels\n\u25cb  Living Sectors\n\u25cb  Data Centres\n\u2022  Publications\nBack\nPublications\nFlagship publications\n\u25cb  The Wealth Report\n\u25cb  Active Capital\n\u25cb  London Report\n\u25cb  Rural Report\n\u25cb  Your Space\n\n\n\u25cb  Asia Pacific Horizon\n\u25cb  UK Residential Investment Report\nFeatured publications\n\u25cb  European Logistics\n\u25cb  European Office\n\u25cb  Alpine Report\n\u25cb  Africa Report\n\u25cb  M25 & South East Office Market Report\n\u25cb  Waterfront View\n\u25cb  ESG Property Investor Survey\n\u2022  Locations\nBack\nLocations\nWorld regions\n\u25cb  Africa\n\u25cb  Americas\n\u25cb  Asia-Pacific\n\u25cb  Australasia\n\u25cb  Europe\n\u25cb  Global\n\u25cb  Middle East\nCountries and cities\n\u25cb  UK\n\u25cb  Australia\n\u25cb  London\n\u25cb  France\n\u25cb  Spain\n\u25cb  Italy\n\u25cb  Switzerland\n\u25cb  Portugal\n\u25cb  United States\n\u2022  Subscribe\n\n\n\u2022  All Publications\n\n\n",

The casualty list has been \nlighter, with no major shockwaves, \nsuggesting a much steadier \noccupational market overall.\n\t\u008a\nKnight Frank\u2019s Retailer Watchlist \nsuggests this calm may hold. \nTwo-thirds of the Top 300 UK \nretailers are rated \u201clow risk\u201d with \nno immediate danger of failure. \nOnly 19% are identified as a \u201cmajor \nrisk\u201d and many of those potentially \nteetering on the brink are digital-\nfirst players (9%) rather than bricks-\nand-mortar/multi-channel staples. \nAnalysis weighted to turnover \nreduces the proportion of physical \nand multi-channel retailers at \n\u201cmajor risk\u201d to just 2%. \n\t\u008a\nThe balance of store openings \nand closures settled into a more \npredictable rhythm in 2024 for a \nthird consecutive year.

Out-of-town \nformats are leading the way, with Retail \nParks achieving a rare net gain of +0.4% \nnet openings, while the High Street \n(-1.5%) and Shopping Centres (-1.0%) \nremain under more pressure.\n\t\u008a\nVacancy rates reflect these challenges. \nRetail Parks have seen vacancies slashed \nto a lean 6.8% but Shopping Centres saw \na more modest -20 bps improvement to \n17.7%, whilst the High Street has been \nstatic at 14.0%. Overall, retail and leisure \nunit vacancies have held steady at 14.0% \nfor five consecutive quarters. Vacancy \nin the prime markets is much lower in \nall cases as the gap between the best and \nthe rest continues to widen.\nRental Growth &  \nRenewed Confidence\n\t\u008a\nDemand for physical Retail remained \nrobust in 2024, with several major \nretailers reinforcing their commitment \nto bricks-and-mortar stores. Industry \nleaders such as M&S, Aldi, Next and \nPrimark not only expanded their \nportfolios but also prioritised significant \ninvestments in store upgrades and \nmodernisation, highlighting a renewed \nemphasis on enhancing the in-person \nshopping experience to stay ahead in an \nincreasingly competitive landscape.\n\t\u008a\nNewer entrants have also contributed \nto the sector\u2019s momentum, with brands \nlike Sephora, Sostrene Grene and \nMiniso moving to establish or expand \ntheir UK physical presence. Their \nactivities signal growing confidence in \nthe long-term viability of physical retail, \neven as the sector navigates mounting \nbudgetary pressures.\n\t\u008a\nOne clear area of progress is rental \ngrowth. Retail rents are forecast to rise \nby +1.3% in 2024, marking a positive \nshift across all sub-sectors. Retail \nWarehousing leads the way with a \nrobust +1.9%, while Shopping Centres \nare finally returning to positive territory \nwith +1.2%. High Streets, too, are \nholding their ground, with a respectable \n+1.6%, enough to support a cautiously \noptimistic outlook for the market.\n\t\u008a\nIf there was a cloud on the horizon, \nit was the new Labour Government\u2019s \nAutumn Budget. Delivering a \u201ctriple \nwhammy\u201d of rising costs (employer \nNational Insurance contributions, \nminimum wage hikes and business \nrate increases) which threaten to \nsqueeze operators\u2019 margins. A bitter \npill to swallow, but unlikely to trigger \na sector-wide crisis. Some will double \ndown on efficiency and automation to \nweather the storm. Others may scale \nback expansion plans, reconsider \ntheir store portfolios or raise prices \nfor consumers to make the numbers \nadd up.\nInvestment Markets\n\t\u008a\nA steady recovery through 2024,  \nthat was beginning to gather \nmomentum in the second half of the \nyear, was slowed during Q4 by the \ndouble blow of the Autumn Budget in \nOctober along with the US Election  \nin November. Primary concerns  \nrelate to inflationary measures \nreversing the rapid reduction in \ncore inflation, along with increasing \npressure on low margin retailers \nneeding to fund employer  \nNational Insurance contributions  \n(not to mention the impact on  \nPrivate Investors considering \ninheritance tax liabilities).\nProperty\nSector\nPurchaser\nVendor\nPrice\nNIY %\nBrookfield Retail Warehouse Portfolio\nRetail Warehouse\nBritish Land\nBrookfield\n\u00a3600,000,000\n7.15%\nArnison Retail Park, Durham\nRetail Warehouse\nRealty Corp\nCBRE IM\n\u00a3110,000,000\n7.00%\nLongwell Green Retail Park, Bristol\nRetail Warehouse\nCBRE IM\nSterling Ventures / Letter One*\n\u00a322,590,000\n5.60%\nSainsbury's, Southgate, Huddersfield\nFoodstore\nSupermarket REIT\nM&G Real Estate\n\u00a349,700,000\n7.60%\nTesco, Linkway, St Helens\nFoodstore\nPrivate Overseas\nAviva Investors\n\u00a353,820,000\n7.00%\nProject Jade Foodstore Portfolio\nFoodstore\nPIMCO\nM&G Real Estate / Gingko Tree\n\u00a3200,000,000\n7.85%\nExchange Buildings, Birmingham\nHigh Street\nCorum XL\nOrchard Street IM*\n\u00a323,400,000\n8.75%\n7-8 Queen Street, Oxford\nHigh Street\nPrivate Investor\nPrivate Investor\n\u00a33,780,000\n5.90%\n185-205 Old Street, London\nHigh Street\nMeadow Partners\nPrivate Investor\n\u00a340,000,000\n6.90%\nCentre MK, Milton Keynes (50%)\nShopping Centre\nRoyal London*\nAustralian Super\n\u00a3142,000,000\n9.25%\nLiverpool 1, Liverpool (93%) - Under Offer\nShopping Centre\nADIA/Grosvenor\nLandSec\n\u00a3500,000,000\n7.00%\nWestquay, Southampton (50%)\nShopping Centre\nHammerson\nGIC\n\u00a3135,000,000\n9.00%\n*Advised by Knight Frank\nKey Transactions - 2024\n\n\nRE TAIL INVESTM ENT U PDATE\n5\n\t\u008a\nA slowing of the reduction in the \nBank of England Base Rate (and an \nexpectation now that the trajectory \nthrough 2025 will be shallower than \nexpected), coupled with outward \nmovement in SONIA swap rates to \naround 3.85% (5 years) at the time of \nwriting, is likely to take until the new \nyear to unwind. Notwithstanding this \nmomentary pause, most investors are \napproaching the Retail sectors with \ngreater positivity than in any year \nsince 2018. \n\t\u008a\nAll Retail is forecast to return 8.2% on \nthe MSCI Index in 2024 and remains \none of the most appealing high-return \nsectors in the UK investment markets \n(MSCI forecasts for All Property at \n5.1%, Industrial at 7.4% and Offices \nat -0.3%). Retail Warehousing is due \nto deliver a remarkable return of \n12.4% in 2024 and will be a significant \noutperformer. However, all of the \nRetail sectors now offer appealing risk \nadjusted returns which is attracting \na deepening pool of investors to the \nRetail markets.\nRetail Warehousing\n\t\u008a\nRetail Warehousing continues \nits stellar performance with deal \nvolumes of \u00a32.4 billion, up 30% on \n2023. Demand continues to originate \nfrom numerous sources, all attracted \nby robust occupational dynamics, \nwith next to no vacancy in prime \nmarkets coupled with limited future \ndevelopment. Rental growth seems \na surety and is already evidenced \nin some retail parks, along with \ninward yield shift (75 bps through \n2024 to date) \u2013 it is easy to see why \nso many buyers have these on their \nrequirement lists.\n\t\u008a\nLarger lot sizes (often Shopping Parks) \nprincipally appeal to REIT investors \n(namely British Land), overseas \nbuyers (US Realty) and select UK \nfunds (Columbia Threadneedle). These \nconviction buyers typically seek yields \nin excess of 7.00% NIY in return for \ntransacting at a larger scale, typified \nby British Land\u2019s acquisitions of the \nBrookfield retail warehousing portfolio \nin two stages \u2013 firstly acquiring parks \nin Didcot and Merthyr Tydfil for \n\u00a3159m / 7.10% NIY followed by parks \nin Middlesbrough, Telford, Falkirk, \nNottingham, Rugby, Waterlooville and \nSt Helens for \u00a3441m / 7.20% NIY. \n\t\u008a\nInstitutional demand for retail \nwarehousing investments continues \nunabated. Most of this originates from \nlocal authority pension mandates \nmanaged by the likes of CBRE IM, \nabrdn, DTZ IM and Knight Frank \nIM. The only deterrent to these \ninvestors appears to be lot size and \nenvironmental concerns, principally \nrelating to flooding. \n\t\u008a\nWithin target ranges of \u00a315-40m, \nmost sales processes have attracted \nnumerous fund bidders with sales at \nLongwell Green, Bristol to CBRE IM \nat \u00a322.59m / 5.60% NIY (Knight Frank \nadvised the vendor), along with Anchor \nRetail Park, Mile End and Ivybridge \nRetail Park, Twickenham both thought \nto be under offer to mainstream \nfunds ahead of quoting pricing of \n\u00a330m / 5.50% NIY. Indeed, even some \ninvestments with environmental \nconcerns, such as Plough Lane, \nWimbledon (selling to M&G at \u00a333m \n/ 5.75% NIY) tick enough boxes for \ncompromises to be accepted in return \nfor a pricing discount. \n\t\u008a\nWith deep pools of new institutional \ncapital from the likes of Border to Coast, \nACCESS and LGPS Central looking for \ndeployment in the coming years, we \nsee no change to this level of demand \nand with potentially tens of billions to \nspend, we expect some will filter into \nthe in-town retail sectors as well as out \nof town settings.\nFoodstores\n\t\u008a\nDespite the Foodstore market remaining \none of the most popular investment \nsectors, transaction volumes have are \nrelatively subdued at \u00a3985m for the year \n(down 63% on the exceptional volumes \nfor 2023).

Given the fine \ntrading margins on which they  \noperate they will surely attempt \nto insulate the shopper from the \ninflationary impact of these measures, \nbut it is perhaps inevitable that some \nprice rises will find their way into \nstores and onto shelves. \n\t\u008a\nSpecialist buyers and Institutions \ncontinue to trawl the market for \nopportunities and owners/buyers \nof such covenants should still be \ncomforted that they remain among  \nthe best businesses around, and  \nlonger term prospects of rental \nand capital performance remain \nsound. These operators\u2019 continued \nwillingness to take up pre-emption \noptions to acquire stores they  \noccupy indicates their healthy  \ncash positions and commitment to \ntheir store infrastructure.\nHigh Street\n\t\u008a\nThe High Street investment market \nremains the domain of the Private \nInvestor, with the vast majority of \ntransactions taking place involving \nprivate capital. It is easy to understand \nwhy, with now-stable covenants paying \nrebased rents in often fashionable \nlocations and digestible lot sizes, \nmaking these investments an obvious \ntarget for these groups. Only 1 in 4 \ntransactions take place with repeat \nbuyers so predicting which buyer is \nlikely to acquire is very challenging.\n\t\u008a\n\tHigh Streets in Greater London, along \nwith affluent towns in the South \nEast, remain the most favourable \nmarkets, largely due to stronger \nconsumer spending dynamics and \nhigher alternative use values (despite \na greater acceptance now that physical \nretail is here to stay). Investments in \naffluent London suburbs such as 107-143 \nMuswell Hill Broadway (under offer at \n\u00a316m / 6.55% NIY) and Crescent Arcade, \nGreenwich (sold at \u00a325m / 7.25% NIY) \nare prime examples. Larger rent rolls \non traditional prime pitches in major \nUK cities (Buchanan Street, Glasgow; \nMarket Street, Manchester; New Street, \nBirmingham; Briggate, Leeds) have \nexposed these investments to greater \nscrutiny and so fewer have traded \nthroughout the year. \n\t\u008a\nThe relative discount in yields at 6.50% \nagainst other more keenly priced sectors \n(e.g. Industrial prime yields at 5.00% and \nRetail Warehousing at 5.50%) is sufficient \ncompensation for the additional \nperceived risk of investing in the High \nStreet space. We expect traditional \ninvestor types to see the appeal of \nthis space in the short term, with the \nopportunity to aggregate portfolios of \nhigh quality stock. French SCPI Property \nfunds including Corum, Sofidy and Iroko \nZen are among the first institutional \nmovers, owning similar investments on \nthe continent and now targeting the UK \nfor sustainable high yields. \n\n\nRE TAIL INVESTM ENT U PDATE\n7\nShopping Centres \n\t\u008a\nInterest in the Shopping Centre \nspace is the strongest it has been \nfor 5 years. A growing acceptance of \ntheir relevance, along with limited \nopportunities to acquire assets of \nscale at such discounted yields are \ndriving major investors to consider \nthe sector once again. However, what \nwas expected to be a flurry of sales \nactivity did not materialise in the \nsecond half of the year. A number of \nlarger sales originating from owners \nseeking to exit since (and in some \ncases before) covid were anticipated \nto reach the market. Instead, open \nmarket sales processes tended to \noriginate from administrative or \nreceivership situations which has \nbeen typical in the Shopping Centre \nmarket for the last few years. \n\t\u008a\nThis has not dampened deal \nvolumes though, with \u00a32.17 billion \nof transactions approaching the \n10 year average of \u00a32.26 billion \nexcluding Covid (but still some way \nbehind historic peaks of \u00a33-5 billion). \nOne third of the transactions have \ninvolved existing owners upsizing \nin their prime assets. As a result, the \naverage deal size has increased this \nyear, which is a trend we expect to \ncontinue. The likes of M&G (50% of \nCribbs Causeway, Bristol at \u00a3110m \n/ 8.25% NIY), Hammerson (50% of \nWest Quay, Southampton at \u00a3135m \n/ 9.00% NIY) and Norges (50% of \nMeadowhall, Sheffield at \u00a3363m / \n8.00% NIY) have all upsized in  \ntheir existing assets this year.  \nRoyal London, advised by Knight \nFrank, recently added a 50% interest \nin Centre:MK, Milton Keynes  \n(\u00a3140m / 9.00% NIY) in another  \nshare sale example.\n\t\u008a\nPrincipally, these owners are buying \ninto the opportunity for strong, \nrisk-adjusted returns from the \nprime sectors and yields here look \nincreasingly favourable at 7.50%. \nEqually, they are purchasing shares \nof assets they already own at historic \ndiscounts with good prospects of \nvalue recovery.

We believe the long-term drivers of industrial \nproperty demand remain positive and broad-based, with a \nsubstantial runway for further growth supported by the global \nmegatrends of Digitalisation and Deglobalisation. \nWe believe the risks posed by higher US tariff rates on \noccupation of the Industrial property are limited and more \nasset and occupier-specific rather than broad-based; a survey \nof 263 multi-let Industrial tenants over Q2 2025 found just \n8.5% expected to be impacted by tariffs, with the majority \nestimating an impact of under 10% of profits.1\nMatt Soffair,  \nSenior Research Manager\nBill Page \nHead of Real Estate Research\nAssumptions, opinions, and estimates are provided for illustrative purposes only.

Our estimates suggest that Industrial \nassets - on average - tend to be less energy intensive than \nan average commercial building,3 with the additional cost of \ntransitioning an \u2018average\u2019 asset to net zero the equivalent of \n3% of asset capital value for London Industrial, versus 5% for \nregional logistics and an All Property average of 7%. \n2.

UK institutional allocations to the \nsector have grown from 13.6% to 34.8% between 2010 and \n2024,4 supported by capital value growth and asset creation. \nAllocations to the Industrial sector have been a key driver of \nalpha in recent years for real estate funds; as at Q1 2025, the \ntop performing quartile of UK funds over the prior 10 years had \na 59.7% weighting towards Industrial, versus 19.5% for the \nbottom quartile (as shown in the first chart on page 5).\n4\n\n\n2025  |  UK Industrial: Positioning for the next phase of growth \n2025  |  UK Industrial: Positioning for the next phase of growth \n6\n7\nWhile take-up continues to normalise following the post-\nCovid surge in demand, in our view, the fundamentals of \noccupation in the Industrial real estate market remain robust. \nRental growth continues to outstrip other sectors, with yields \nmore generous than the equally in-favour residential sector, \naccording to the MSCI UK Quarterly Index.

Previous published L&G research highlights seven sub-sectors of Industrial: London and South-East multi-lets, rest of UK multi-lets, regional logistics, urban \nlogistics, data centres, self-storage, trade parks, cold storage and open storage\nAssumptions, opinions, and estimates are provided for illustrative purposes only. There is no guarantee that any forecasts \nmade will come to pass. Past performance is not a guide to the future.\nDo yields provide a sufficient risk premium given \nmoderating growth expectations?\nnarrow, predominantly due to the relative re-rating of yields \nacross commercial property sectors and moderating Industrial \nrental growth prospects following a period of unsustainable \n5%+ growth. This, in our view, necessitates a more targeted \napproach within the Industrial sector. While in recent years \na rising tide has lifted all boats, we believe selectivity across \nsub-sectors,5 assets and investment styles will be increasingly \nimportant in delivering alpha, alongside active asset \nmanagement.\n01\n02\n03\n04\n05\n06\nIs Industrial real estate more sensitive to the \neconomy than other real estate sectors?\nHas the role of e-commerce played out in Industrial?\nWill Deglobalisation derail or deliver sector \nperformance?\nWhere are supply risks and constraints most \nevident?\nHow do sub-sectors within UK Industrial compare \non a cyclical and structural basis?\n6\n7\n\n\n2025  |  UK Industrial: Positioning for the next phase of growth \n2025  |  UK Industrial: Positioning for the next phase of growth \n8\n9\nWe believe the recent slowdown in occupational demand for \nIndustrial property has been caused by cyclical, rather than \nstructural, factors, with three main driving forces:\n2000\n2003\n2007\n2008\n2009\n2010\n2011\n2012\n2013\n2014\n2015\n2017\n2021\n2022\n2023\n2024\n -\n 5,000\n 10,000\n 15,000\n 20,000\n 25,000\n 30,000\n 35,000\n-6\n-4\n-2\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\nGDP Growth\nAnnual take-up (\u2018000s sqft)\nPeak e-commerce \ngrowth years\nCorrelation (exc. \n2020): 46%\nStandard Industrial (sub-100k sq ft) take-up versus GDP\nSource: L&G, PMA (2025)\nIndustrial rents have always had a lagging correlation to \nthe UK economy. Between 1987 and 2012, the correlation \nbetween UK GDP and the subsequent year\u2019s Industrial \nERV growth was 67%, versus 70% across All Property. \nThis relationship weakened after 2012, the point at which \ne-commerce penetration levels surpassed 10% of total retail \nsales. As the pace of e-commerce sales growth moderates, it \nis reasonable to anticipate that Industrial\u2019s sensitivity to the \nmacro environment will revert closer to its long-term average. \nWhen comparing the UK Industrial take-up for sub-100,000 \nsq ft units versus UK GDP growth, it is evident that Industrial \noccupier demand has always been correlated to growth \nin the UK economy. However, this relationship moderated \nduring peak years of e-commerce growth. Slower Industrial \ntake up over 2023 and 2024 is in keeping with its long-term \nrelationship with the economy. \nIs Industrial more sensitive to the economy \nthan other real estate sectors?\nIn our view, the observed slowdown in Industrial occupational \nmarkets is consistent with the sector\u2019s historic sensitivity \nto economic growth, which has been exacerbated by a \nnormalisation in occupational demand following the post-\nCovid surge in supply and rental growth. An exceptional period \nof e-commerce growth may also be moderating, leaving the \nsector more sensitive than before to broader economic growth \nthan has been apparent in its recent history. \nGreater sensitivity to economic growth increases the \nimportance of occupier diversification within an Industrial real \nestate exposure. As the below mix of occupied floorspace \n/ take-up demonstrates, the regional logistics space has a \nmore concentrated tenant base, predominantly focused on the \nretail / e-commerce and manufacturing sectors. In comparison, \nmulti-lets have exposure to a broader range of occupier types, \nmeaning this sector is likely less exposed to risks that may \nbe present in an individual industry or affecting a specific \ncompany. We note that 56.7% of income comes from the \ntop 10 occupiers for Industrial assets in the MSCI Quarterly \nindex, versus 17.4% across L&G managed small to mid-sized \nmulti-let estates. Urban logistics assets, an attractive subset of \nthe multi-let market, typically occupying units sized between \n10,000 and 70,000 sq ft, would ordinarily have an occupier mix \nand concentration sitting somewhere in between multi-lets \nand regional logistics.\nDistribution, 33%\nTrade, 24%\nProduction & \nManufacturing, 10%\nSelf-Storage, 6%\nEngineering, 5%\n Off-Site\nServicing, 4%\nOn-Site Servicing,\n4%\nFood &\nBeverage, 4%\nRetail, 4%\nLeisure, 2%\nResearch &\nDevelopment, 2%\nHealthcare, 1%\nOther, 1%\n3PL, 28%\nManufacturing, \n22%\nOnline retail, 17%\nOther, 8%\nWholesale, 6%\nFood \nProduction, 5%\nGrocery retail, 4%\nAutomotive, 3%\nParcel, 1%\nHigh St Retail, 7%\nMulti-let occupier mix (L&G multi-let portfolio, ERV)\nRegional logistics, 2021-2025 take-up\nSource: L&G, Savills (2025) Asset allocation is subject to change.\n01\n02\n03\nWeak UK economic growth\nPost-Covid supply increases, particularly of \nregional logistics\nRental growth reverting to pre-Covid trend, \ndriven by the above two factors\n01.\nAssumptions, opinions, and estimates are provided for illustrative purposes only.

We believe more supply-constrained sub-sectors of Industrial real estate that serve \ne-commerce \u2013 for example, urban rather than regional logistics and cities such as London with tight Industrial land supply and \nfit-for-purpose logistics stock \u2013 are best placed to navigate this period.\nE-commerce has been an important growth driver for \nIndustrial, with retailers and e-commerce operators accounting \nfor an increasing share of take-up over the past two decades, \npositively impacting growth throughout Industrial typologies. \nWhile the rate of e-commerce growth has moderated as the \nsector matures, forecasters continue to expect the channel \nto account for an increasing share of overall retail sales. We \nbelieve there are persuasive demographic and technological \ntrends that support this picture of sustained growth. Younger \ngenerations are the most prolific online shoppers, with 96% \nof 16-24-year-olds and almost all 25-34-year-olds shopping \nonline versus 65% of over 65-year-olds.6 This should benefit \ne-commerce penetration rates as younger generations \nprogressively move into their peak consumption years of 30-\n49. \nAre we there yet?  \nHas the role of e-commerce played out in Industrial?\nFrom a technological standpoint, we continue to see a greater \nlevel of innovation taking place through e-commerce channels; \nfor example, social commerce \u2013 the sale of products directly \nthrough social media channels \u2013 is expected to grow at three \ntimes the rate of overall consumer spending.7 In addition, \nwe anticipate many of the retail-related efficiencies and \ninnovation catalysed by generative AI and robotics are more \nlikely to benefit e-commerce, be it via more efficient inventory \nmanagement, autonomous or driverless last-mile delivery or \nAI shopping assistants, particularly in retail categories which \nhave historically been slower adopters of e-commerce, such \nas grocery.

This topic is not new; over \nthe past decade, UK supply chains have been subjected to \nmore frequent external shocks, incorporating Brexit, Covid-19 \nand the Russia-Ukraine war as well as \u2018Liberation Day\u2019. \nWithin the UK, there is little hard evidence of onshoring to \ndate. Manufacturing output has broadly flat lined in real terms \nsince Brexit, albeit this has been hindered by a 12.6% decline \nin goods exports since 2019.8 While inventory levels have \nnot materially changed at an aggregate level over recent \nyears, the UK has experienced periodic surges in inventories, \nincluding during Q4 2024 when concerns regarding potential \nchanges to US trade relations emerged. We anticipate a focus \non supply chain resilience and flexibility is likely to remain. We \nsee this particularly boosting demand from third-party logistics \noperators (3PLs), who can enable retailers and businesses \nto more easily flex their inventory levels based on market \nconditions. \nImport data provides more tangible evidence of supply chain \nreconfiguration post 2020. Non-EU imports account for a larger \nshare of UK imports, led by China, India and Turkey, while \nCentral and Eastern Europe countries9 are accounting for a \ngrowing share of European exports. On balance, UK evidence \nis indicative of greater emphasis on supply chain resilience, \nlocalisation and diversification, rather than onshoring. This \nmay yet evolve given persistent geopolitical tensions, which \nis already increasing the focus on supporting domestic \nproduction capabilities for critical industries, including Defence, \nas indicated in the UK government\u2019s most recent Modern \nIndustrial Strategy. Anecdotal leasing evidence suggests some \npick up in defence-related Industrial occupation in defence-\noriented local economies. \nThe experience of the US could give an indication of the future, \ndespite it fundamentally being a different economy to the UK in \nterms of scale, fiscal firepower and manufacturing capabilities. \nBank of America research found that reshoring has created \n20% of manufacturing jobs in the last 15 years, with half of \nthese in the past five years due to policy initiatives. This has \nhad a knock-on impact on real estate space requirements, \nwith NAIOP reporting a record high in US manufacturing \nconstruction pipeline in 2023, representing 11.5% of the \nnational Industrial pipeline.\n8.

In such an environment, we \nwould anticipate that supply will play an increasingly critical \nrole in dictating future long-term rental growth. We believe \ntargeting segments and geographies with higher barriers to \nnew supply is likely to be beneficial to performance.\nSupply elasticity across the Industrial real estate sector varies \nconsiderably, with regional logistics development historically \nbeing far more responsive to increased occupational demand. \nWe expect this to modestly reduce potential long-term rental \ngrowth, along with increasing the risk of depreciation as stock \nages.\nIndustrial stock by size band (\u2018000 sq ft)\n0\n500,000\n1,000,000\n1,500,000\n2,000,000\n2,500,000\n2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024\nIndustrial stock (<100,000 sq ft)\nWarehouse stock (>100,000 sq ft)\nSource: PMA (2025), VOA (2025)\nFrom a geographic perspective, London has seen Industrial \nstock reduce by an average of -0.6% p.a. over 2000-2025.

A sustainable yield is \ncalculated by building up a target rate of return based on risk-\nfree rates, UK property\u2019s historic risk premium, sector rental \ngrowth expectations and netting off depreciation and fund \nmanagement costs. As the below demonstrates, we see UK \nValuation yields (Q2 2025) versus \u2018Sustainable\u2019 yield\nAll Property\nRetail Parks\nShopping Centres\nCity Offices\nSE Offices\nLondon Multi-Let\nRest of SE Multi-Let\nNorthern Multi-Let\nRegional Logistics\nUrban Logistics\nLeisure\nPBSA\nBTR - London\nBTR - Non-London\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\nEquivalent Yield, Q2 2024\nSustainable Yield, 2025-2029 (%)\nGood value\nFair value\nWeaker value\nSource: LGIM RA Research, PMA, MSCI Quarterly Index as at Q2 2025. Sustainable yield calculated by taking assumption of risk-free rates (assumed 4%) + property \nrisk premium + assumption of fund management costs \u2013 expected future net income growth. \nPast performance is not a guide to the future.  \nAn alternative approach to understanding relative value is by \ncomparing a forward-looking risk premium across sectors and \nversus history. Between 1980 and 2024, UK property delivered \nan average risk premium10 of 2.3% p.a. above 10-year gilts. \nBased on PMA\u2019s rental growth expectations for 2025-2029 \nand in-house depreciation assumptions, we compute UK \nmulti-lets as having a forward risk premium of 2.8% versus \n2.2% for regional logistics. While both are reasonable relative \nto All Property, this supports our view that there is a more \ncompelling relative value case for multi-lets over regional \nlogistics.  \nStrategic implications\nIndustrial real estate has treated investors well in recent years, \nunderpinned by structural shifts in occupational demand. We \nbelieve these structural drivers of demand have enduring \nmomentum and will continue to result in strong relative \nperformance for the sector in the future, underpinned by \npositive investor sentiment and capital flows.\nWhile momentum remains, we believe tighter yields and a \nnarrower spread in expected returns to other real estate sectors \nnecessitates a more targeted approach to the sector to drive \nrelative outperformance. We continue to favour segments and \ngeographies that benefit from both structural demand tailwinds \nand barriers to new supply, with London / the Southeast multi-\nlets and urban logistics screening as particularly attractive. \nNotably, these segments also provide opportunities to move \nfurther up the risk/return spectrum, driving higher returns \nvia active asset management, targeted developments and \ndensification. In an increasingly crowded market, a more \ngranular focus on underlying fundamentals, asset selection and \nhigher growth segments within the Industrial sector is key to \ndelivering stronger relative performance.\n10. Defined here as annual excess return above 10-year gilt yields\nproperty screening as reasonable value, with a stronger relative \nvalue case for multi-lets in the Southeast and, in particular, \nLondon, along with Urban Logistics. However, in totality, the \nvalue case for Industrial relative to other sectors is less clear-\ncut, reiterating the importance of selection within the sector, \nboth at a segment and asset-level.\n06.\nAssumptions, opinions, and estimates are provided for illustrative purposes only.

The annualised \ntotal return is marginally down on the forecast from the previous quarter, although still a positive outlook \ncompared to earlier quarters.  \n  \n\n\n14\nUK Consensus Forecasts\nSurvey results by sector\nOffice\n11 forecasts\nRental value growth (%)\nCapital value growth (%)\nTotal return (%)\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2025-29\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2025-29\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2025-29\nMaximum\n5.3\n3.6\n4.0\n3.8\n7.6\n7.6\n7.6\n7.6\n8.7\n9.6\n8.5\n8.2\nMinimum\n1.0\n1.5\n0.8\n1.6\n-0.6\n-1.0\n-0.1\n-0.4\n3.0\n3.7\n4.7\n4.4\nRange\n4.3\n2.1\n3.2\n2.2\n8.2\n8.6\n7.7\n8.0\n5.7\n5.9\n3.8\n3.8\nMedian\n2.2\n2.0\n2.0\n2.5\n1.8\n2.7\n2.8\n2.5\n6.2\n6.7\n7.3\n6.5\nMean\n2.6\n2.2\n2.2\n2.4\n2.1\n2.8\n2.8\n2.5\n6.1\n6.7\n6.8\n6.5\nIndustrial\n11 forecasts\nRental Value Growth (%)\nCapital Value Growth (%)\nTotal Return (%)\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2025-29\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2025-29\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2025-29\nMaximum\n5.0\n4.5\n4.7\n4.5\n9.9\n6.5\n6.8\n5.1\n14.7\n11.0\n11.3\n9.7\nMinimum\n1.7\n0.8\n0.8\n2.3\n1.7\n1.3\n1.6\n2.9\n6.2\n5.8\n6.0\n7.4\nRange\n3.3\n3.7\n3.9\n2.1\n8.2\n5.2\n5.3\n2.2\n8.5\n5.2\n5.3\n2.3\nMedian\n3.9\n3.3\n2.8\n3.2\n4.3\n4.6\n3.7\n3.6\n8.9\n9.0\n8.2\n8.3\nMean\n3.8\n3.1\n2.9\n3.2\n4.6\n4.2\n4.0\n3.8\n9.3\n8.8\n8.6\n8.4\nStandard Retail\n10 forecasts\nRental Value Growth (%)\nCapital Value Growth (%)\nTotal Return (%)\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2025-29\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2025-29\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2025-29\nMaximum\n4.4\n3.9\n3.6\n3.8\n7.1\n3.9\n3.9\n3.6\n11.7\n8.7\n8.4\n8.1\nMinimum\n0.0\n0.5\n-0.2\n0.6\n-0.2\n0.1\n0.3\n0.4\n5.0\n6.3\n4.5\n5.4\nRange\n4.4\n3.4\n3.8\n3.2\n7.3\n3.8\n3.6\n3.2\n6.7\n2.4\n3.9\n2.7\nMedian\n2.3\n1.9\n1.7\n2.0\n1.9\n2.6\n1.5\n1.7\n7.0\n7.7\n6.6\n7.0\nMean\n2.5\n1.9\n1.7\n1.9\n2.3\n2.5\n1.6\n1.9\n7.4\n7.5\n6.6\n6.9\nShopping Centre\n10 forecasts\nRental Value Growth (%)\nCapital Value Growth (%)\nTotal Return (%)\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2025-29\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2025-29\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2025-29\nMaximum\n2.7\n2.5\n2.5\n2.4\n5.3\n4.4\n2.9\n3.0\n13.8\n12.1\n10.9\n11.1\nMinimum\n0.3\n0.4\n-0.3\n0.0\n0.6\n0.1\n-0.9\n-0.5\n7.0\n6.8\n5.2\n6.0\nRange\n2.4\n2.1\n2.8\n2.4\n4.7\n4.3\n3.8\n3.5\n6.8\n5.3\n5.7\n5.1\nMedian\n1.6\n1.3\n1.4\n1.3\n1.6\n1.9\n1.6\n1.4\n10.0\n8.8\n8.3\n8.3\nMean\n1.5\n1.4\n1.4\n1.4\n2.3\n2.0\n1.2\n1.4\n9.7\n9.2\n8.3\n8.5\nRetail Warehouse\n10 forecasts\nRental Value Growth (%)\nCapital Value Growth (%)\nTotal Return (%)\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2025-29\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2025-29\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2025-29\nMaximum\n4.2\n3.1\n3.0\n3.0\n7.6\n5.3\n4.7\n3.6\n13.5\n11.6\n10.7\n9.4\nMinimum\n0.5\n1.3\n1.5\n1.1\n0.5\n1.6\n1.0\n0.8\n6.4\n7.6\n6.8\n6.6\nRange\n3.7\n1.8\n1.5\n1.9\n7.1\n3.6\n3.7\n2.8\n7.1\n4.1\n3.9\n2.8\nMedian\n2.0\n2.0\n2.1\n2.1\n3.1\n3.0\n2.6\n2.4\n9.2\n8.9\n8.3\n8.3\nMean\n2.3\n2.2\n2.1\n2.2\n3.3\n3.1\n2.6\n2.4\n9.4\n9.1\n8.4\n8.3\n\n\n15\nUK Consensus Forecasts\nSurvey results by sector\nAll Property\n11 forecasts\nRental Value Growth (%)\nCapital Value Growth (%)\nTotal Return (%)\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2025-29\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2025-29\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2025-29\nMaximum\n5.0\n3.7\n4.0\n3.8\n6.5\n4.4\n4.7\n4.2\n11.9\n9.6\n9.5\n9.5\nMinimum\n1.1\n1.8\n1.6\n1.8\n0.7\n1.3\n2.3\n1.9\n5.8\n6.3\n7.1\n6.9\nRange\n3.9\n1.9\n2.4\n2.0\n5.8\n3.1\n2.4\n2.3\n6.1\n3.3\n2.4\n2.6\nStd.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY \n0.1 \nIceni Projects has been commissioned by the Leicester and Leicestershire (L&L) local \nauthorities, contracting to North West Leicestershire District Council, to update the need for \nstrategic distribution floorspace (defined as units of 9,000 sq.m+) looking ahead to 2046; and \nconsider how this need may be apportioned.  \n0.2 \nThe L&L authorities have historically worked together to plan for strategic B8 development. \nThe most recent evidence at a L&L level is set out within the 2021 Warehousing and Logistics \nin Leicester and Leicestershire: Managing Growth and Change\u2019 report (\u2018the 2021 Study\u2019). The \n2021 Study provided an assessment and recommendation on the future quantum of \nwarehouse floorspace and area of land required to accommodate it that should be planned for \nbetween 2020 and 2041 across Leicester & Leicestershire (L&L), as well as a number of wider \nmatters.  \n0.3 \nThis report provides an update to the strategic B8 need set out in the 2021 report and then \nmoves on to consider apportionment of need. Many other components of the 2021 report \nremain relevant.  \nProperty Market Review Spring 2025: Strategic Distribution  \n0.4 \nStrategic Distribution vacancy rates in Leicestershire fell notably between 2016 and 2022, \nreaching a low of 2.2%, but have since risen to a historical high of 8.2% (spring 2025). A similar \ntrend has been seen across the East Midlands and the UK which have a vacancy rate of 9.0% \nand 6.4% respectively. During the COVID-19 pandemic there was a spike in demand for \ndistribution premises, increasing completions and occupation, exacerbated by trade \ndisruptions. From 2024 the market has eased, with a weaker macro economic backdrop, \ntogether with higher interest rates. However the long term outlook for strategic premises is \nconsidered strong, driven by demand for high quality space; and population and economic \ngrowth. This is underlined by net absorption (space occupied) increasingly annually since \n2014, with a significant rise from 2019 onwards, reflective of market drivers.  \n\n\n5 \n \n \n \n \nUpdated Strategic B8 Requirements \n0.5 \nThis report considers needs for strategic B8 development across Leicester and Leicestershire \nover the period to 2046 to inform plan-making. This is in line with paragraph 31 of the PPG \n(Housing and Economic Needs Assessment) which requires local authorities to work together \nto assess the future need for logistics across the relevant market geography. Within this study \na range of forecasting approaches are considered and then triangulated. The needs forecasted \nby all of the models considered in this report are set out below: \n0.6 \nTraffic growth and replacement space models produce the lowest need and are outstripped \nby market facing models. In part this may be due to an exclusion of ancillary space in the \nmodel, reducing outputs by 10-20%. Overall Iceni considers that other market based models \nare more likely to represent future needs, taking into account dynamic changes in business \noperations and premises needs and the strengthening of demand in this nationally important \nlocation. \n0.7 \nThe gross completions model has historically aligned more closely with the traffic growth \nand replacement demand model, however now completions are increasing above this model, \nreflecting activity over time. \n0.8 \nNet absorption models have been considered herein with varying rates of sensitivity to \nconsider historic suppressed demand. Suppressed demand considers how absorption (space \noccupied) may have performed differently with greater levels of historic space availability. \nWhen considered at 5% this falls below completion rates (or in line with completions after \naccounting for some on site recycling). Suppressed demand adjustment at 8% is the highest \nlevel of need is generated, although this may be higher than natural market optimum for the \nstrategic market considering costs of entry and costs of vacancy.  \n0.9 \nIncorporated within the completions and traffic growth and replacement models is a land \nrecycling component. Taking a practical approach to best use of land, reflecting the NPPF \n(chapter 11) the recycling of optimally placed sites is expected to become an opportunity over \nthe next twenty years, particularly with demand focused on highest quality buildings and \ngovernment EPC rating requirement increases.  \n\n\n6 \n \n \n \n \n0.10 \nOverall it is recommended that the gross completions model including recycling is used \nfor strategic planning. This because: \n\u2022 \nThe lower range of the replacement demand models do not align well to market signals, \nwhilst there is uncertainty regarding the market equilibrium inputs from the highest \nsuppressed demand models \n\u2022 \nThe preferred model broadly aligns with the suppressed demand at 5% model and is a \nmodel outcome that is broadly in the centre of all ranges provides a balanced position. \n\u2022 \nThe preferred model also allows for acknowledgement that COVID-19 period deliveries \nhave been much heightened, but that the market has cooled subsequently.  \n\u2022 \nIt includes a land recycling component, taking a practical approach to best use of land, \nreflecting the NPPF (chapter 11). \n0.11 \nOverall this preferred model indicates that there is a gross need for 3,969,400 sq.m of \nadditional floorspace for strategic B8 development over the 23 year forecast period. For \nreference the 2021 study forecasted a (lower) need of 2,571,000 sq.m for a 21 year period \n(2020-41). The higher need now shown, reflects the structural shift in the logistics market (as \ndiscussed in section 3) that has occurred since the 2021 study was completed.  \n0.12 \nThe table below splits the additional floorspace requirement between rail-served and road-\nserved sites, assuming a 34% split.

This \nassumes that the various locations considered will, in the fullness of time, be achievable and \ndeliverable, although at present many do not have the infrastructure in place, as highlighted \nby the transport authorities through this work. Whilst this may be considered prohibitive to \ngrowth, it is evident that there is a significant scale of economic opportunity associated with \ninvestment if suitable schemes can be designed and funded. Effectively, this report should \nassist in making the case for investment. \n \n1 Identify \nBroad \nLocations\n\u2022Focus on road network junctions as primary locations in AOs\n\u2022Defined as a buffer zone around transport corridors / SRFI (optimal 5-10 \nminute travel time from SRN junctions, 1km buffer from a B-road (i.e. \ndirectly at the junction).\n2 Filter \nland\n\u2022Remove land categorised as 'absolute constraint' as well as existing \nallocations and permissions\n3 Identify \nLand \nCapacity\n\u2022Identify unconstrained land parcels within the search parameters, including \nproposed or draft allocations and promoted sites (CfS)\n4 Assess \nBroad \nLocations\n\u2022Complete assessment for each broad location - assessing proximity to SRN, \njunction capacity, proxmimty to RFI, labour accessibility, public transport \naccess, spatial strategy and infrastructure requirements\n5 \nDeliverabi\nlity and \nPhasing\n\u2022Review access arrangements and junction capacity constraints through Highways \nAuthority engagement and identify corridor implications on deliverability and \nphasing.\n6 Rank\n\u2022Overall assessment of broad location and RAG rating \n\n\n10 \n \n \n \n \nFigure 0.2 Map of Broad Locations and RAG Rating  \n \nStep 2 Apportioning Need \n0.21 \nThe approach follows the principles of: \n\u2022 \nIdentification of potential broad locations for future strategic distribution floorspace using \nspecific search parameters, including minimum site size, constraints and proximity to the \nSRN; \n\n\n11 \n \n \n \n \n\u2022 \nFurther cross check and inclusion of sites included in emerging Local Plans and call for \nsites or promoted submissions to identify maximum capacity at each broad location; \n\u2022 \nAssessment and scoring of broad locations; \n\u2022 \nDerive a target apportionment: prioritising the expansion of rail-served sites / delivery of a \nnew SRFI and reflecting corridor ranking; \n\u2022 \nApportion the additional floorspace requirement using the target apportionment, net off \ncompletions/commitments and consider rail-based locations first, meeting the residual \nrequirement at road-based locations; \n\u2022 \nTest to target apportionment against assessed land capacity, re-apportioning the shortfall \nto areas with capacity using the target split (reweighted); \n\u2022 \nChecking distribution and phasing of apportionment outcomes. \n\n\n12 \n \n \n \n \nOverview  \nFigure 0.3 Approach to Apportionment  \n \nRail-based Opportunities \n0.22 \nWhilst the Hinckley NRFI DCO decision was refused, the potential for a new rail freight \ninterchange to be delivered at this location within the study period, should not be dismissed. \nThe decision letter1 agrees that there is a compelling need for the Proposed Development. The \nDCO application was refused on the basis of most notably insufficient transport modelling \nevidence assessing the impacts at M1 J21/M69 J3; non-compliance with the road safety \nrequirements; and the highways safety impacts on the village of Sapcote as a result of the \nHGV re-routing allowing the slip roads to be constructed.  \n \n \n1https://infrastructure.planninginspectorate.gov.uk/wp-content/ipc/uploads/projects/TR050007/TR050007-002725-\nRefusal%20Letter%20-%20Hinckley%20NRFI.pdf  \n1\n\u2022Derive a target split by Area of Opportunity, prioritising rail opportunities and \nmarket ranking of AOs. \n2\n\u2022Net off commitments in each AO from target split, providing the requirement to be \nmet through additional supply.\n3\n\u2022Road / Rail Split: Identify rail-based opportunities.

The development could therefore still come forward within the study period \nto 2046. This aligns with National planning policy, principally the NPPF and the National \nPlanning Statement for National Networks, which clearly expects large scale freight \ndevelopments to be built at locations which have access to the railway network.   \n0.24 \nIn order to meet the rail-served need it is therefore assumed that 650,000 sq.m of growth can \nbe delivered at Hinckley NRFI within the study period, taking the rail-served residual need \ndown to 700,000 sq.m. A further 240,000 sq.m of rail-served capacity is identified south of East \nMidlands Airport, providing an extension to the existing EMG rail-served site. There are no \nfurther rail-served opportunities within the study area. \nTarget Apportionment \n0.25 \nThe table below derives a target apportionment of the additional floorspace requirement. Stage \n1 starts with an equal split across the five Areas of Opportunity that have broad locations \nidentified and capacity. No broad locations or land parcels were identified in AO2 and it is \ntherefore discounted from the apportionment approach from here onwards. \n0.26 \nStage 2 adjusts the target split upwards or downwards based on market ranking and the \nopportunities to meet a rail-based need. The apportionment is uplifted to 25% within AO1 (M69) \nand AO3, recognising the rail-based opportunities as noted above and the prime market \nlocations of both areas. No further adjustment are made to AO4 (M1 North) and AO6 (M1 \nSouth), reflecting that they prime market locations but with no rail-based opportunities. AO5 \n(A42) sees a downwards adjustment to 10%, recognising that it is a secondary location, \nparticularly given its lower labour market availability and non-motorway status.  \n \n\n\n14 \n \n \n \n \nTable 0.3 Target Apportionment by AO \n \nBroad \nLocations \nStage 1: \nEqual Split \nMarket Rank \nStage 2: \nAdjusted Split \nTarget \nApportionment \nAO1 \u2013 \nM69/A5 \nM69 \n20% \n1 \nAdjusted \nupwards: rail \nprioritisation \n+5% \n25% \nA5 (North) \nAO2 \u2013 A6 \nN/A \n0% \n3 \nUnadjusted \n0% \nAO3 \u2013 \nEMG \nSouth of \nEMA \n20% \n1 \nAdjusted \nupwards: rail \nprioritisation \n+5% \n25% \nA50 J1 \nKegworth \nAO4 \u2013 M1 \nNorth \nM1 J23 \n20% \n1 \nUnadjusted \n20% \nM1 J22 \nBardon \nAO5 \u2013 \nA42 \nA42 J11 \n20% \n2 \nAdjusted \ndownwards: low \nmarket ranking -\n10% \n10% \nA42 J12 \nA42 J13 \nAO6 \u2013 M1 \nSouth \nMagna \nPark (A5 \nSouth) \n20% \n1 \nUnadjusted \n20% \nM1 J20 \nSource: Iceni analysis \n0.27 \nThe table below apportions the additional floorspace required (3,969,400 sq.m) based on the \ntarget apportionment and nets off the existing completions and commitments to derive a \nresidual floorspace required.  \n0.28 \nThe residual floorspace requirement is met through the rail-based locations in AO1 and AO3, \nas discussed above, yielding 890,000 sqm of floorspace at rail-served sites.

In particular, detailed work will need to be undertaken through \nthe Local Plan making process, or in the case of Hinckley NRFI, through the DCO process, \nacross issues such as land availability, landscape, biodiversity, and importantly transport \nassessment and modelling. Strategic Transport Assessment and/or Local Plan Transport \nAssessment will be required to take the broad locations considered and overall apportionment \nforward to allocation stage and support the selection of appropriate sites to meet identified \nneeds. This report does not usurp Local Plan making or DCO process but is intended as a \nreasonable approach at a scale reflective of the market area for this strategic sector to \napportioning the need of strategic distribution.  \n0.35 \nThe methodology is designed as such that it can be readily updated as required when \ncircumstances change to reflect new information, constraints or developments.  \n\n\n \n20 \n \n \n \n \n1. \nINTRODUCTION \n1.1 \nIceni Projects has been commissioned by the Leicester and Leicestershire (L&L) local \nauthorities, contracting to North West Leicestershire District Council, to update the previous \nassessment of the need for strategic distribution floorspace (defined as B8 units of 9,000 \nsq.m+) looking ahead to 2046; and consider how this need may be apportioned.  \n1.2 \nThe L&L authorities have historically worked together to plan for strategic B8 development. \nThe most recent evidence on at a L&L level is set out within the 2021 Warehousing and \nLogistics in Leicester and Leicestershire: Managing Growth and Change\u2019 report (\u2018the 2021 \nStudy\u2019). The 2021 Study provided an assessment and recommendation on the future volume \nof warehouse floorspace and area of land required to accommodate it that should be planned \nfor between 2020 and 2041 across Leicester & Leicestershire (L&L), as well as a number of \nwider matters.  \n1.3 \nThis report provides an update to the strategic B8 need set out in the 2021 report and moves \non to consider apportionment of need. Many other components of that 2021 report remain \nrelevant.  \n1.4 \nThe evidence indicates that demand has been bolstered in recent years by continued growth \nin e-commerce, with both a long-term growth trend together with a particular demand spike \nduring Covid-19; alongside the effects of Brexit increasing stockholding requirements and a \nshift to a \u2018just in case\u2019 model which requires higher stock volumes; as well as occupier \nrequirements for new modern space including those with sufficient height and power to support \nautomation. These factors together supported very strong take-up between 2019-23, but more \nrecently take up has slowed and vacancies in industrial and distribution property have risen, in \npart reflecting higher construction costs and interest rates. This report takes into account a \nbalanced approach to the assessment of long-term demand which is expected to affect \ndevelopment needs to 2046.  \n1.5 \nThe evolution of market demand in recent years points to a higher overall requirement for \nstrategic B8 development, based on triangulating different models; and therefore a higher total \n\n\n \n21 \n \n \n \n \nto plan for in the future compared with the 2021 assessment. This report identifies the updated \nneeds position and then looks at a supply side apportionment of need as required by the PPG, \nbased on an assessment of potential broad locations across Leicester and Leicestershire to \ninform the preparation of individual Local Plans. \n1.6 \nThe report is structured as follows: \n\u2022 \nSection 2: Context \u2013 Policy and Previous Evidence \n\u2022 \nSection 3: Property Market Review \n\u2022 \nSection 4: Updated Strategic B8 Requirements \n\u2022 \nSection 5: Supply-Demand Balance \n\u2022 \nSection 6: Broad Location Identification and Assessment \n\u2022 \nSection 7: Approach to Apportionment \n\u2022 \nSection 8: Conclusions and Recommendations \n \n\n\n \n22 \n \n \n \n \n2. \nCONTEXT: POLICY AND PREVIOUS EVIDENCE  \n2.1 \nThis section considers national, regional and local policy evidence base documents as they \nrelate to planning for warehousing and logistics.  \nNational Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) (December 2024)  \n2.2 \nThe NPPF sets out the Government\u2019s planning policies and how these should be applied. It \nprovides a framework within which locally prepared plans can provide for development in a \nsustainable manner and how planning applications should be considered (Para 1).  \n2.3 \nThe purpose of the planning system is to support sustainable development \u2013 balancing \neconomic, social and environmental objectives. It identifies that these are interdependent and \nneed to be pursued in mutually supportive ways (so that opportunities can be taken to secure \nnet gains across each of the different objectives).  \n2.4 \nThe economic objective is to help build a strong, responsive and competitive economy, by \nensuring that sufficient land of the right types is available in the right places and at the right \ntime to support growth, innovation and improved productivity; and by identifying and \ncoordinating the provision of infrastructure (Para 8). \n2.5 \nThe planning system is intended to be Plan-led (Para 15). \n2.6 \nPlans should be prepared with the objective of addressing sustainable development and \nprepared positively, in a way that is aspirational but deliverable (Para 16). \n\n\n \n23 \n \n \n \n \n2.7 \nPlanning policies and decisions should help create the conditions in which businesses can \ninvest, expand and adapt. Significant weight should be placed on the need to support economic \ngrowth and productivity, taking into account both local business needs and wider opportunities \nfor development (Para 85). \n2.8 \nPara 86 sets out that planning policies should:  \na)  set out a clear economic vision and strategy which positively and proactively encourages \nsustainable economic growth, having regard to the national industrial strategy and any \nrelevant Local Industrial Strategies and other local policies for economic development and \nregeneration;  \nb) set criteria, and identify strategic sites, for local and inward investment to match the \nstrategy and to meet anticipated needs over the plan period;  \nc) pay particular regard to facilitating development to meet the needs of a modern \neconomy, including by identifying suitable locations for uses such as laboratories, \ngigafactories, data centres, digital infrastructure, freight and logistics;  \nd) seek to address potential barriers to investment, such as inadequate infrastructure, \nservices or housing, or a poor environment; and  \ne) be flexible enough to accommodate needs not anticipated in the plan, and allow for new \nand flexible working practices and spaces to enable a rapid response to changes in \neconomic circumstances\u2019 \n2.9 \nPara 87 states that planning policies and decisions should recognise and address the specific \nlocational requirements of different sectors. This includes making provision for:  \na)  clusters or networks of knowledge and data-driven, creative or high technology industries; \nand for new, expanded or upgraded facilities and infrastructure that are needed to support \nthe growth of these industries (including data centres and grid connections);  \n\n\n \n24 \n \n \n \n \nb) storage and distribution operations at a variety of scales and in suitably accessible \nlocations that allow for the efficient and reliable handling of goods, especially where this \nis needed to support the supply chain, transport innovation and decarbonisation; and  \nc) the expansion or modernisation of other industries of local, regional or national importance \nto support economic growth and resilience\u2019. \n2.10 \nThe emphasis on the recent changes in the NPPF clearly shows a movement towards ensuring \na suitable range of commercial premises to meet the requirements of industry including freight \nand logistics. \nInvest 2035: the UK\u2019s Modern Industrial Strategy (October 2024) \n2.11 \nThe Industrial Strategy was published in June 2025, following the consultation that ran from \n14 October to 25  November 2024. \n2.12 \nThe final Strategy confirms eight priority growth sectors across services and manufacturing, \nbuilding on existing and emerging strengths: Advanced Manufacturing; Clean Energy \nIndustries; Creative Industries; Defence; Digital and Technologies; Financial Services; Life \nSciences; and Professional and Business Services.  \n2.13 \nAlthough logistics is not listed as a stand-alone sector, the Strategy recognises its essential \nenabling role\u2014particularly for advanced manufacturing and defence\u2014by underpinning \nresilient supply chains and supporting national competitiveness. \n2.14 \nThe strategy commits to creating a \u201cpro-business environment\u201d through cross-cutting policies \non skills, innovation, infrastructure and investment. It places strong emphasis on place-based \ngrowth, targeting city regions, high-potential clusters and strategic industrial locations for \nfocused investment. \n \n\n\n \n25 \n \n \n \n \n2.15 \nThese policy objectives are expected to support and lower barriers to industrial and logistics \ndevelopment, aligning with planning strategies that safeguard and expand strategic \nemployment land. \nPlanning Practice Guidance (PPG) \u2013 Housing and Economic Needs Assessment, 2020 \n2.16 \nWhilst the PPG sets out guidance on how future employment land needs should be assessed \nthere is no standard method. Paragraphs 26 to 30 set out a methodology that implies a \ntriangulation of a range of forecasting approaches (including labour demand and supply, \nemployment land / property  take-up. The guidance emphasises the importance of having \nregard to economic cycles, market signals and business / agent engagement.  \n2.17 \nParagraph 31 more specifically provides guidance on planning for future logistics needs, \nsetting out the requirement for local authorities across the relevant market area to assess the \nneed for logistics and apportion requirements to most appropriate locations. \nPara 31 \n \nHow can authorities assess need and allocate space for logistics? \u2026Where a need for such \nfacilities may exist, strategic policy-making authorities should collaborate with other \nauthorities, infrastructure providers and other interests to identify the scale of need across \nthe relevant market areas. This can be informed by: \n\u2022 \nengagement with logistics developers and occupiers to understand the changing \nnature of requirements in terms of the type, size and location of facilities, including \nthe impact of new and emerging technologies; \n\u2022 \nanalysis of market signals, including trends in take up and the availability of logistics \nland and floorspace across the relevant market geographies; \n\u2022 \nanalysis of economic forecasts to identify potential changes in demand and \nanticipated growth in sectors likely to occupy logistics facilities, or which require \nsupport from the sector; and \n\u2022 \nengagement with Local Enterprise Partnerships and review of their plans and \nstrategies, including economic priorities within Local Industrial Strategies. \nStrategic policy-making authorities will then need to consider the most appropriate \nlocations for meeting these identified needs (whether through the expansion of existing \nsites or development of new ones). \n\n\n \n26 \n \n \n \n \n \nWarehousing and Logistics in Leicester & Leicestershire 2021  \n2.18 \nIn 2021, Leicester and Leicestershire authorities commissioned GL Hearn with Iceni Projects \nand MDS Transmodal to undertake the \u2018Warehousing and Logistics in Leicester and \nLeicestershire: Managing growth and change\u2019 study. The study brought together a wide range \nof topics related to the current and future needs of the sector, with an emphasis in particular \non future floorspace and land needs to 2041. This study provides selective updates to that \nreport. \n2.19 \nIn the 2021 Study it was recommended that the authorities plan for around 2,570,000 sq.m of \nadditional floorspace to 2041. This included a flexible margin of 643,000 sq.m (equivalent to a \n5 years of average completions) with the need based on the high replacement, sensitivity test \ntraffic growth model. \nTable 2.1 Range of modelled strategic warehousing needs 2020-41 \nSource: GL Hearn 2021 \n\n\n \n27 \n \n \n \n \n2.20 \nIn broad terms, the preferred needs modelling took account of freight traffic growth based on \nthe MDS Transmodal GB Freight Model, together with replacement of older stock which is over \n30 years old. In the preferred scenario the freight traffic growth was uplifted by 15% to \nnotionally consider how growth in e-commerce might impact on development needs. This uplift \nwas however estimated before any actual data was available on the demand effects.  \n2.21 \nBased on 43% of future need provided at rail served sites, which reflects an expected increase \nin rail-orientated freight in the future, the Study identified a shortfall of 768,000 sq.m (307 ha) \nat rail served sites which should be planned for (including margin) after taking into account \nexisting supply and supply pipeline. This was expected to be met by the proposed Hinckley \nNRFI. \n2.22 \nBased on 57% of future need at non-rail (i.e. road) served sites, the Study identified a shortfall \nof 392,000 sq.m (112 ha) at non-rail served sites across L&L which should be planned for \n(including margin) after taking into account existing supply pipeline. For scale, this is less than \nthe extension of Magna Park North of over 400,000 sq.m. \n2.23 \nThe 2021 report identified that the Leicestershire and East Midlands warehousing stock is \nlargely road based currently and that increasing the volume of goods moved by rail is essential \nfor the decarbonisation agenda. The study outlined that an optimum position at 2041 would be \nthat 60% of new warehouses are provided at rail served sites however the 2021 study planned \nfor an average of 43% as a graduated rate of achieving this. The proportion of need met at rail-\nserved sites has been reviewed within this study in Section 4.  \n\n\n \n28 \n \n \n \n \nTable 2.2 Strategic Distribution Floorspace Needs 2020-41 \n\u2022 \nSource: Warehousing and Logistics in Leicester and Leicestershire: Managing growth and \nchange(April 2021) \n2.24 \nThe Study identified six broad \u2018areas of opportunity\u2019 (AO) where new strategic logistics sites \nshould be located. The broad areas (as shown in in figure 2.1) were deemed suitable to \naccommodate sites of the size, scale, location and transport connectivity required by the \nmarket. The areas identified met the following criteria:  \n\u2022 \nGood connections with the strategic highway network \u2013 sites served by motorways and \nlong-distance dual carriageways or within reasonable distance of such routes by non-\nstrategic highways suitable for conveying HGVs; \n\u2022 \nGood connections with the railway network \u2013 for rail sites, those capable of \naccommodating a generous loading gauge (minimum W8 gauge); on electrified railways \nline or short distance from one; served by line providing connections to major ports of entry \n(such as Felixstowe, Southampton) and key domestic destinations;  \n\u2022 \nAppropriately located relative to the markets to be served; and \n\n\n \n29 \n \n \n \n \n\u2022 \nIs accessible to labour and located close to areas of employment need. \nFigure 2.1: Areas of Opportunity in Leicestershire \nSource: Warehousing and Logistics in Leicester and Leicestershire: Managing growth and \nchange (April 2021) \n2.25 \nThe six areas of opportunity are located as such: \n\u2022 \nArea 1 \u2013 between Leicester and Hinckley, broadly following the M69 and Leicester-\nNuneaton trainline transport corridors and part of M1; \n\u2022 \nArea 2 \u2013 between Syston and Ratcliffe-on-Soar, broadly following the A6, M1 and Midland \nMain Line transport corridors, incorporating Loughborough; \n\n\n \n30 \n \n \n \n \n\u2022 \nArea 3 - between Ratcliffe-on-Soar and Castle Donington / border with Derbyshire, broadly \nfollowing the A50, M1, the Midland Main Line and the freight only line connecting the \nMidland Main Line (at Trent Junctions) to the Derby-Birmingham train line; \n\u2022 \nArea 4 - to the northwest of Leicester, broadly following the M1 (north) transport corridor; \n\u2022 \nArea 5 - the A42 transport corridor, incorporating Ashby-de-la-Zouch; and \n\u2022 \nArea 6 - M1 corridor south of Leicester. \n2.26 \nIt is of note that the AO1 (M69), AO2 (A6) and AO3 (East Midlands Gateway) are all identified \nas road and rail-based opportunities in the 2021 study. However, at present only AO3 has a \nrailhead. The ability of other AOs to realise rail opportunity will rely on a new rail access being \nbuilt.  \nLeicester and Leicestershire Economic Growth Strategy 2021-30 (November 2021) \n2.27 \nLaunched in late 2021, the strategy aims to drive recovery post-COVID and post-EU transition, \npositioning Leicestershire as a productive, innovative, inclusive and sustainable economy. \n2.28 \nThe strategy recognises the importance of Leicestershire\u2019s role as the UK\u2019s central hub for \nlogistics, supported by assets like East Midlands Airport, East Midlands Gateway SRFI and \nproximity to major motorway links.   \n2.29 \nLogistics is identified as a key driver of employment and productivity, with opportunities tied to \nthe Freeport and increasing demand for sustainable freight solutions.  \n\n\n \n31 \n \n \n \n \n3. \nPROPERTY MARKET REVIEW: STRATEGIC DISTRIBUTION  \n3.1 \nThe 2021 Study was produced at a moment in time at the start of the pandemic and within the \nBrexit transition period. The strategic logistics market has continued to evolve since the \nproduction of the previous study and further information on strategic logistics demand drivers \nare available, including e-commerce growth; \u2018just-in-case\u2019 stock holding requirement and \nmodern premises requirements. These factors are discussed individually below.   \nGrowth in E-Commerce \n3.2 \nAs reported by the ONS and can be seen in Figure 3.1, in 2010 online retailing was around \n7% of total sales, by 2019 this had reached around 20% before the shock effect of Covid-19 \ndrove this to a high of 36% in Q1 2021. DHL reported that the pandemic had condensed the \ngrowth in e-commerce from 6 years to 6 weeks; and Royal Mail had shipped 117 million more \nparcels by the end of three months to June 2020, compared with the same period in 2019, as \npeople and businesses shifted to online sales during lockdown.  \n3.3 \nAs of Q1 2025, the proportion of online retail sales sits at 27%, falling since the pandemic and \nshowing some softening of demand, but still sits significantly above pre-covid trends and with \na long-term upward projection. A portion of the population\u2019s retailing patterns have permanently \nchanged as a result of the pandemic and the sector continues to transform to meet these \nneeds. There has been a shift in the retail sector away from bricks & mortar stores to an online \npresence.  \n3.4 \nThe trend above supports a particular spike in demand for space in 2021 and 2022, driven by \nCovid-related effects. However the graph indicates a long-term upward trend in retail sales. \nAlthough the last 3 years (2023-25) have seen a broadly stable share of online spend, it is \nimportant to recognise that retail sales are a function of population growth, so whilst the \nproportion of internet sales has begun to stabilise, ongoing population growth will continue to \nbe a driver of internet sales growth and thus logistics space. \n \n\n\n \n32 \n \n \n \n \n Figure 3.1: Internet Sales as a percentage of total retail sales (%)\n \nSource: ONS 2025 \n \n \n3.5 \nThe  chart below reports on the types of occupiers in warehousing in terms of change over \ntime. This highlights the dominance of \u2018third party logistics\u2019 or 3PLs in occupying warehousing \nspace, such as DPD, DHL etc, who facilitate business to business and business to consumer \ndeliveries. Online retail has also grown hugely to 2021, but matured in demand onwards \ntowards 2024.  \n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n2006 NOV\n2007 MAY\n2007 NOV\n2008 MAY\n2008 NOV\n2009 MAY\n2009 NOV\n2010 MAY\n2010 NOV\n2011 MAY\n2011 NOV\n2012 MAY\n2012 NOV\n2013 MAY\n2013 NOV\n2014 MAY\n2014 NOV\n2015 MAY\n2015 NOV\n2016 MAY\n2016 NOV\n2017 MAY\n2017 NOV\n2018 MAY\n2018 NOV\n2019 MAY\n2019 NOV\n2020 MAY\n2020 NOV\n2021 MAY\n2021 NOV\n2022 MAY\n2022 NOV\n2023 MAY\n2023 NOV\n2024 MAY\n2024 NOV\n2025 MAY\nInternet sales as a percentage of total retail sales\nLinear (Long Term Trend (excl. Covid-19))\n\n\n \n33 \n \n \n \n \nFigure 3.2: Occupiers of warehouse by type, time series \n \nSource: UKWA REPORT 2024 / Savills  \n\u2018Just-in-Case\u2019 Stock Requirements  \n3.6 \nOngoing trade disruptions and supply chain uncertainty caused by Brexit has resulted in a \nsurge of demand for \u2018just-in-case\u2019 warehousing allowing companies to hold large inventories \nto minimise supply chain disruptions.  \n3.7 \nThis demand is particularly driven by manufacturing businesses which increasingly require \nadditional warehouse capacity to store stock to prevent delays in the production of goods and \ntherefore losses in revenue.  \n3.8 \nThe \u2018just-in-case\u2019 business model was adopted by many businesses following the end of the \nBrexit transition period at the start of 2021. Due to the timing of the 2021 study, the impact of \nBrexit on supply chain stability was not fully reflected in the modelled floorspace needs. Again, \nthis contributed to particularly strong demand in 2021-22.  \n3.9 \nRecent and ongoing geo-political uncertainty \u2013 including the Suez Canal blockage, Trump-era \ntariffs and conflicts in the Middle East \u2013 are expected to continue driving \u2018just-in-case\u2019 supply-\nchain strategies and associated demand. \n\n\n \n34 \n \n \n \n \nModern Occupier Requirements \n3.10 \nThe volume of goods and scale of parcels being processed, combined with the cost of labour \nand restrictions on labour accessibility, are driving a focus on mechanising the distribution \nprocess.  \n3.11 \nRobotics drives the need for increased levels of power, as does the increasing switch of vans \n(light goods vehicles, LGVs) to electric vehicles. It is also resulting in a need for taller \nwarehousing units, of at least 20-30m in height, which can accommodate automation including \nrobotic pick and packing systems. Many Third-Party Logistics (3PLs) companies are focusing \non electrification, particularly for customer distribution - with DPD leading the \u2018charge\u2019.  \n3.12 \nThere has also been a recent shift in occupier environmental and sustainability requirements. \nEPC legislation currently requires a minimum EPC rating of \u2018E\u2019 in order to be let, with a target \nof EPC \u2018C\u2019 by 2030. There has also been a desire for more complex measurements such as \nBREEAM, which has driven demand for Grade A+ units. Grade A+ units meet occupiers\u2019 ESG2 \naspirations in addition to reducing operational costs. \n3.13 \nThese modern requirements drive the \u2018replacement build\u2019 component (see para 4.13). Older \nwarehousing stock becomes obsolete and requires replacement either in-situ or in more \nsuitable locations.  \n \n \n2 Environmental, social and governance \n\n\n \n35 \n \n \n \n \nConstruction Market Conditions \n3.14 \nDespite the logistics demand boom (or spike) as a result of e-commerce growth through Covid-\n19, Brexit supply chain issues and occupier requirements, the market has seen some cooling \nover recent quarters. \n3.15 \nSince the beginning of the pandemic, construction costs have soared due to supply chain \ndisruptions and tight labour market conditions.  \n3.16 \nHigher interest rates since 2022 have though impacted on construction funding and viability. \nThis has led to decreased investment volumes into the industrial and logistics markets and a \nslowdown of construction. As a result of these factors, the market has cooled down with a \nslowdown in speculative construction starts compared to the 2020-21 market boom.   \nEast Midlands Strategic Market \n3.17 \nSavills3 report (January 2025) that the East Midlands remains the largest UK regional market \ntake-up in 2024, despite continued rise in supply.  \n3.18 \nNearly 5 million sq.ft (465,00 sq.m) of second-hand space has been returned to the market in \nthe past 12 months, most of which was built before 2000, due to two key factors \u2013 occupier \nconsolidation into new speculatively developed units and company failures. Vacancy rates \nanalysis suggests a \u2018higher for longer\u2019 scenario as these older units are redeveloped or \nrefurbished to meet modern standard. Ongoing speculative development, along with the return \nof second-hand space has pushed vacancy rates to a record high of 10.3% in the region.  \n3.19 \nThere was 13.6 million sq.ft  (1.3 million sq.m) of vacant strategic units in January 2025, \nmarking a 56% rise over the previous year. However, based on five-year annual take-up rates \nthis represents 2.2 years of supply. Units within the large size bands (+400,000 sq.ft / +37,000 \nsq.m) are however relatively undersupplied across the region.  \n \n \n3 https://www.savills.co.uk/research_articles/229130/371307-0  \n\n\n \n36 \n \n \n \n \n3.20 \nIn terms of the grade, of available space on the market, 29% is considered new speculative \ndevelopment, 38% is second-hand grade A, 23% second-hand grade B and remaining 10% is \ngrade C (which may be considered obsolete due to its inability to meet modern occupier \nrequirements). \nFigure 3.3 East Midlands Available Supply of Strategic Units by Grade\n \n3.21 \nDespite the rise in supply, transactional activity in 2024 exceedrf the long-term average, \nreaching 8.0 million sq.ft (743,000 sq.m) across 22 transactions in the region, this represents \na 65% rise above pre-Covid annual average. Take-up over the last 7 years, from 2018 \nonwards, has been notably higher than the longer-term trend since 2007.  \n\n\n \n37 \n \n \n \n \n3.22 \nOccupier activity in 2024 aligned with trends seen across the UK, with third-party logistics (3PL) \nfirms acquiring the most space, accounting for 35% of total activity. High street retailers \naccounted for 21%, online retailers 12%, and food producers 10%.  \nFigure 3.4 East Midlands Strategic Unit Take-Up \n\u2022 \n \nLeicestershire Strategic Distribution Market \n3.23 \nThe figure below shows the vacancy rates for strategic B8 floorspace in Leicestershire, the \nEast Midlands and the UK. Vacancy rates in Leicestershire fell between 2016 and 2022, \nreaching a low of 2.2% and have since risen to a historical high of 8.2%. A similar trend has \nbeen seen across the East Midlands and the UK which currently have a vacancy rate of 9.0% \nand 6.4%.  \n\n\n \n38 \n \n \n \n \n3.24 \nVacancy and / or availability rates of 5-10% are considered optimal in the industrial market to \nallow for occupier choice and market churn \u2013 within the strategic unit market a lower rate of 5-\n8% may be appropriate, partly as build to suit (which will not show as vacant) is more common \nfor very large units, and as the market tends to operate more tightly than the broader market \ndue to costs associated with bringing forward land and sites. At times through the past decade \nstrategic B8 vacancy rates were at a sub-optimal level, although Leicestershire less so than \nelsewhere, and the lack of supply likely restricted market activity. Whilst vacancy rates have \nrecently been rising and currently sit at an optimal level, a notable amount of vacant stock is \naged and of poor quality and artificially inflating vacancy rates \u2013 this is explored in more detail \nwithin this chapter.  \nFigure 3.5 Vacancy Rates \u2013 Strategic B8 Floorspace \n \nSource: CoStar (February 2025) \n3.25 \nThe figure below shows the net absorption and net delivery of strategic B8 floorspace across \nLeicestershire. Net absorption represents the increase in occupied floorspace (move ins minus \n0.0%\n1.0%\n2.0%\n3.0%\n4.0%\n5.0%\n6.0%\n7.0%\n8.0%\n9.0%\n10.0%\n2025 YTD\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2021\n2020\n2019\n2018\n2017\n2016\n2015\n2014\n2013\n2012\nLeicestershire\nEast Midlands\nUK\n\n\n \n39 \n \n \n \n \nmove outs). Net absorption increased year on year 2014 to 2022, with a lull in growth in 2020 \nand 2021 likely due to lack of supply and Covid-19 restrictions on construction, supported by \nvacancy rates of 3%. Net absorption has on average matched net deliveries and in the 2019-\n22 period, data indicates that everything constructed was leased within the same year.  \n3.26 \nFor the years 2023 and 2024, the level of take-up significantly reduced, alongside the level of \ndeliveries, however deliveries exceeded take-up, causing vacancy rates to rise. Net absorption \ndoes not however pick up occupiers moving from an older unit to a newly constructed unit \nwithin the same year. The rise in vacancy is caused in particular by the older stock being \nvacated. When excluding vacant pre-2000s stock i.e. obsolete stock, the effective vacancy \nrate is much lower at 5.5%.   \nFigure 3.6 Leicestershire Strategic B8 Net Absorption, Net Deliveries and Vacancy \n \nSource: CoStar 2025 \n0.0%\n1.0%\n2.0%\n3.0%\n4.0%\n5.0%\n6.0%\n7.0%\n8.0%\n9.0%\n0\n100,000\n200,000\n300,000\n400,000\n500,000\n600,000\n700,000\n800,000\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2021\n2020\n2019\n2018\n2017\n2016\n2015\n2014\n2013\n2012\nFloorspace (sq.m)\nVacancy Rate\nNet Absorption\nNet Deliveries\nVacancy\n\n\n \n40 \n \n \n \n \nLeasing Activity \n3.27 \nFor the purposes of assessing leasing activity herein, only \u201cStrategic\u201d units over 9,000 sq.m \n(100,000 sq.ft) have been included4.

\n\u2022 \nGross Completions; \n\u2022 \nNet Absorption (Past Take-up); and \n\u2022 \nNet Absorption with a Supressed Demand Adjustment at 5% and 8% rate. \n4.3 \nThe need for strategic B8 floorspace has been forecasted for the 23-year period from 2023-\n46. \nTraffic Growth and Replacement Demand  \n4.4 \nThis land-use forecast methodology is derived from the following key factors relating to new \nlogistics facilities: \n\u2022 \nThe continual process over time whereby existing large-scale warehousing becomes \nphysically or functionally obsolete, and consequently needs to be replaced by a new \nbuilding (replacement build); and \n\u2022 \nLong-term growth in the demand for goods in the wider economy and the subsequent \nneed for additional floorspace in order to handle that growth (growth build).   \n4.5 \nNew warehouse units can, of course, incorporate both the replacement and growth build \nelements under the same roof.   \n\n\n \n48 \n \n \n \n \n4.6 \nExisting warehouse capacity can be quantified from available data sources, with a view then \nreached as to the likely replacement rate based on our experience of the logistics sector and \nmarket trends.  Freight traffic growth (a proxy for growth in the demand for goods) can be \nforecast using econometric models; in this case the MDST GB Freight Model (used to produce \nforecasts for Network Rail, the DfT and National Highways among other bodies).  The traffic \ngrowth is then related to floorspace using cargo storage density and throughput rates expected \nat a modern distribution centre. \n4.7 \nThis forecasting methodology was relied upon in the 2021 Study and further details on the \nmethodology can be found in Section 8 of the 2021 report.  \n4.8 \nThe baseline forecast year adopted for this forecast exercise is 2023 (floorspace and traffic \nvolumes).  The key primary output is total new-build rates over a future time period (i.e. future \ndemand for new-build units), measured as sq.m of warehouse floorspace.  In this case, new-\nbuild rates up to 2051 have been forecast, with intervening years 2036, 2041 and 2046 also \nestimated.  The forecasts are for the East Midlands region and for the county of Leicestershire6.   \nExisting Warehouse Capacity \n4.9 \nGiven the above, the starting point of the land-use forecasting process is therefore to quantify \nthe existing supply of large-scale logistics and distribution floorspace capacity within the East \nMidlands region and Leicestershire.  The data has been derived from MDST\u2019s warehouse \ndatabase, which has been compiled from the Valuation Office Agency (VOA) non-domestic \nRating List records (a record of all commercial property in England and Wales by floorspace \nfunction and location, collated for Business Rates purposes).  We have interrogated the raw \ndatabase and extracted floorspace data within commercial buildings with a designation \n\u2018warehouse\u2019 or a similar classification.  For clarification, this includes: \n \n \n \n6 Defined as the ceremonial county of Leicestershire, which in local government terms incorporates the seven district / borough \ncouncils and the unitary City of Leicester council area.  \n\n\n \n49 \n \n \n \n \n\u2022 \nFloorspace designated as \u2018warehouse\u2019 or similar within a building whose primary \nclassification is \u2018Warehouse and Premises\u2019 i.e. a building purposely built to receive, store \nand distribute cargo (the classic distribution centre); and \n\u2022 \nFloorspace designated as \u2018warehouse\u2019 or similar within a building that has some other \nprimary classification e.g. a \u2018Factory and Premises\u2019 which contains floorspace used to \nstore and distribute goods manufactured at that site. \n4.10 \nProperty where the warehouse floorspace (as defined) is greater than 9,000 sq.m in total has \nbeen included, this broadly equating to buildings around 100,000 sq.ft or larger, the logistics \nindustry\u2019s recognised definition of a large-scale distribution centre (\u2018big box\u2019).  Other ancillary \nfloorspace designations (e.g. offices) have been excluded, meaning that the total \u2018headline\u2019 \nsize of the warehouse (e.g. that which a property agent or developer may quote in their publicity \nmaterial) will be greater once these other floorspace functions are included.  This may mean \nthat completions and market data reports higher outcomes than this model. Further, while the \ntotal quantum of \u2018warehouse\u2019 or similar floorspace within an individual property is greater than \n9,000 sq.m, the actual floorspace may be distributed over two or more different areas (zones) \nwithin the individual commercial property.   \n4.11 \nAcross England and Wales a total of 2,594 buildings covering 55 million sq.m of floorspace \ncan be identified from the VOA Rating List data (as at Q4 2023).  A breakdown of these figures \nby standard regions are presented in the table below.   \nTable 4.1 Warehouse Floorspace by Region 2023 \nTotal Floorspace \nTotal Number \nAverage \nFloorspace \n(000s sq.m) \nUnits \nper unit (sq.m) \nEast Midlands \n11,640 \n446 \n26,098 \nNorth West \n8,475 \n431 \n19,662 \nWest Midlands \n8,172 \n415 \n19,691 \nYorkshire/Humber \n7,524 \n348 \n21,621 \nEast \n6,076 \n299 \n20,322 \nSouth East \n4,414 \n215 \n20,532 \nSouth West \n3,220 \n143 \n22,520 \nNorth East \n2,110 \n91 \n23,183 \n\n\n \n50 \n \n \n \n \nLondon \n1,902 \n127 \n14,976 \nWales \n1,540 \n79 \n19,489 \n \n \n \nTotal \n55,072 \n2,594 \n21,231 \nSource: MDST Warehouse database, derived from VOA Rating List data \n4.12 \nThe table shows that the East Midlands region hosts just over 11.6 million sq.m of floorspace \nacross 446 commercial properties.

There has been some significant growth \nrecorded in the East Midlands, West Midlands, East and Yorkshire/Humber.  Growth nationally \nhas been driven by a number of factors, including Brexit and Covid (a need to hold higher \nlevels of inventory to maintain supply chain resilience) and the growth of on-line (e-commerce) \nretailing. These issues were considered in Section 3.  \nTable 4.4 Warehouse Floorspace by Region 2023 and 2018 \n000s sq.m \nRegion \n2023 \n2018 \n+/- vs 2018 \nEast Midlands \n11,640 \n9,022 \n2,618 \nNorth West \n8,475 \n8,150 \n325 \nWest Midlands \n8,172 \n7,279 \n893 \nYorkshire/Humber \n7,524 \n6,629 \n895 \nEast \n6,076 \n4,744 \n1,332 \nSouth East \n4,414 \n3,736 \n679 \nSouth West \n3,220 \n2,724 \n496 \nNorth East \n2,110 \n1,703 \n407 \nLondon \n1,902 \n1,992 \n-90 \nWales \n1,540 \n1,545 \n-5 \nTotal \n55,072 \n47,524 \n7,549 \n4.15 \nSource: MDST Warehouse database, derived from VOA Rating List data \n\n\n \n52 \n \n \n \n \nReplacement Build \n4.16 \nMost newly built floorspace is a replacement for existing warehouse stock which is 'life expired'.  \nIn many cases, this will be due to functional obsolescence rather than warehouse units being \nphysically obsolete (i.e. many older buildings will be structurally sound).  This is particularly the \ncase concerning the growth of e-commerce, where many older buildings cannot accommodate \nthe automated picking/packaging equipment required for on-line sales, or the ability to handle \ndistribution to retail outlets alongside direct to home e-commerce deliveries under the same \nroof.  Many existing retailers have therefore commissioned more modern facilities (to service \ntheir e-commerce platforms) which have directly replaced older distribution buildings (e.g. \nMarks & Spencer at East Midlands Distribution Centre).  Also, new floorspace has been built \nfor emerging e-commerce only retailers, such as Amazon or ASOS, much of which has \neffectively replaced floorspace previously operated by \u2018bricks and mortar\u2019 retailers which have \ngone out of business.     \n4.17 \nA second factor is the ability, when compared with 20-30 years ago, to operate much larger \ndistribution buildings.  This has been facilitated by advances in modern ICT inventory \nmanagement systems which have permitted much larger warehouses to be operated more \nefficiently than was previously the case.  As a result, many operators have sought economies \nof scale through merging operations based at multiple sites to one new location.   \n4.18 \nFinally, changing market conditions, both within specific companies/sectors and in the wider \neconomy, means that warehouse operations might need to relocate in order to remain \ncompetitive.  Occupiers who previously sourced goods from domestic suppliers but now \npredominantly import from overseas markers via deep-sea ports may seek a new location at a \nrail-linked site in order to remain competitive.  \n4.19 \nEssentially, buildings reach the end of their useful economic life and are no longer suitable for \ntheir original designed use; a more modern replacement facility is therefore required.  A \nconsequence of this process is that new sites need to be brought forward (or new plots at \nexisting sites) in order to allow occupiers to re-locate to new buildings, thereby releasing the \nexisting facility for refurbishment or demolition.   \n\n\n \n53 \n \n \n \n \n4.20 \nIn order to estimate the \u2018replacement build\u2019 element to 2051 (i.e. floorspace which will become \nfunctionally obsolete or in some cases physically obsolete), the existing stock of large-scale \nwarehousing in the East Midlands and Leicestershire study needs to be considered.  This has \nbeen undertaken and is detailed in the table below. \n4.21 \nOn the basis that the average useful economic life of a modern warehouse building is 30 years, \nup to 2051 we could expect around 93% of the existing warehouse stock in the areas being \nconsidered to require replacement (i.e. 28 years/30 years = 93%).  Likewise, up to 2041 and \n2046 we could therefore expect around 60% and 77% respectively of the existing warehouse \nstock to require replacement. This can be considered the \u2018high replacement build\u2019 scenario as \nwe have also considered a position where the rate of replacement begins to slow compared \nwith historical trends.  This may extend the useful life to around 40 years.  This suggests that \naround 70% of the existing stock will require replacement up 2051.  This can be considered \nthe \u2018low replacement build\u2019 scenario. \n4.22 \nThe table below shows the estimated \u2018replacement build\u2019 rates under both scenarios for \nLeicestershire and the East Midlands region to 2051. \nTable 4.5 Future Demand \u2013 Replacement of Existing Stock \nExisting Floorspace - \nLeicestershire \n3,533 \n000s sq.m \n \nExisting Floorspace - East \nMidlands \n11,640 \n000s sq.m \n \n \n000s sq.m \n2036 \n2041 \n2046 \n2051 \nHigh Replacement \nReplacement build - \nLeicestershire \n1,531 \n2,120 \n2,709 \n3,298 \nReplacement build - East \nMidlands \n5,044 \n6,984 \n8,924 \n10,864 \nLow Replacement \nReplacement build - \nLeicestershire \n1,148 \n1,590 \n2,032 \n2,473 \nReplacement build - East \nMidlands \n3,783 \n5,238 \n6,693 \n8,148 \nReplacement rate to: \n2036 \n2041 \n2046 \n2051 \nHigh - 30 years \n43% \n60% \n77% \n93% \n\n\n \n54 \n \n \n \n \nLow - 40 years \n33% \n45% \n58% \n70% \n4.23 \nSource: MDST \nGrowth Build \n4.24 \nDemand for warehouse floorspace is driven by the need to handle, store and re-distribute \ncargo. Therefore, future economic growth in the wider economy along with forecast population \nincreases will lead to a growth in the volume of consumer goods handled.  This in turn will lead \nto increasing demand for additional warehouse floorspace.  Consequently, new warehouses \nare constructed partly to accommodate growing traffic volumes over the long term (the \u2018growth \nbuild\u2019 element).   \n4.25 \nIn order to estimate the growth build element two factors need to be considered, namely: \n\u2022 \nThe current (2023) volume of goods which are delivered directly to large-scale distribution \ncentres in Leicestershire and the East Midlands region (i.e. only including those \ncommodities which pass through large-scale distribution centres, so excluding bulk and \nsemi-bulk cargoes such as aggregates and forest products); and \n\u2022 \nLikewise, the volumes of goods that can be expected to be delivered directly to large-scale \ndistribution centres in Leicestershire and the East Midlands region in the forecast years to \n2051. \n4.26 \nBoth the current and forecast volumes (as described) have been produced using the MDS \nTransmodal GB Freight Model, with the subsequent growth in traffic calculated.  The model is \nan analytical tool which can estimate existing freight flows (by origin-destination, mode, \ncommodity and port of entry/departure for international traffics) and generate forecasts for \nfuture years (on the same basis) under different policy and economic scenarios.  It has recently \nbeen used to generate forecasts for the Network Rail, National Highways and Midlands \nConnect.   \n4.27 \nIn 2023, MDS Transmodal produced an updated set of rail freight demand forecasts for \nNetwork Rail for the years 2040/41 and 2050/51 (to inform their long-term planning process).  \nWe have therefore extracted the relevant rail and road forecast traffic volumes from Scenario \n2.  These were the TAG-compliant forecasts which broadly correspond to the Government\u2019s \n\n\n \n55 \n \n \n \n \nlong-term rail freight growth target of 75% by 2050.

Likewise, under the \u2018Low Replacement\u2019 scenario, just over 2.4 million sq.m of \ngross new-build is forecast up to 2046, rising to 2.9 million sq.m up to 2051.  Note that the \noutputs represent the total quantum of new floorspace which is forecast to be built up to 2051.   \nIt is not the \u2018net change\u2019 in floorspace, which planners often consider. \nGross Completions \n4.32 \nGross completions data provides evidence of new-build development levels \u2013 both on new \nsites as well as the redevelopment of existing employment land. Data for strategic B8 units \n(over 9,000 sq.m) across L&L has been used and projected forwards.  \n \n \n7 MPS10 and MPS11 \u2013 9% office floorspace; Hinckley 340 - 10% office floorspace; MPS6 \u2013 10% office floorspace. \n \n\n\n \n58 \n \n \n \n \n4.33 \nGross completions data for strategic B8 units for the 12 year period from 2012/13 to 2023/24 \nhas been provided by the Leicestershire local authorities8. The previous 2021 study used data \nfor the 2012/13 to 2019/20 period (8 years). \n4.34 \nAs the chart below shows, the quantum of B8 floorspace delivered over the 2019-24 period is \n2.9 times greater than that over the preceding 5 years. This reflects the effects of the factors \ndescribed in Section 3.  \n4.35 \nThe 2012/13-23/24 trend effectively contains two differing growth periods of demand. Low to \nmedium growth from 2012/13 to 2018/19 and high growth from 2019/20 to 2023/24 driven by \nthe e-commerce pandemic boom and Brexit supply chain securitisation.  \n4.36 \nThere has been some weakening of demand since the end of the pandemic due to economic \nconditions and construction costs, however it is appropriate to assume that demand levels will \nstabilise, and over the longer-term population growth, changing business functions and \nshopping habits will continue to support e-commerce and therefore demand for warehouse \nspace.  \n4.37 \nIt is however unrealistic to expect the exceptional short-term demand spike seen between \n2019/20-2022/23 to be replicated given the one-off impacts and associated adjustments to \nBrexit and Covid-19.  \n4.38 \nUsing a long-term trend (2012/13-2023/24), in place of the recent higher 5-year trend, smooths \nthe forecasted demand for warehousing. It reflects that there will be steady warehousing \ngrowth in the short-term which levels off in later years and reflects the economic cycle that will \noccur during the study period.  \n \n \n8 2023/24 data was supplemented by CoStar data given monitoring data availability and reviewed by local authorities \n\n\n \n59 \n \n \n \n \nFigure 4.1 Leicestershire Strategic B8 Completions (sq.m) \n \nSource: Iceni Analysis of Council Monitoring Data and CoStar  \n4.39 \nThe annualised gross completions trend for the 2012/13 - 2023/24 period has been rolled \nforward over the 2023-46 forecasting period and a 5-year margin has been applied.

It should be noted that \nplanning permission for the majority of the deliveries in 2022/23 (Mercia Park and EMDC) were \nsubmitted and granted before the start of the pandemic, indicating that strategic unit demand \nwas anticipated, however delivery was probably accelerated by market conditions.  \n4.41 \nThe drop off in completions in 2023/24 (and also anticipated to be slower in 2024/25) is likely \na reflection of the frontloading of scheme delivery in 2022/23 as well as a potential flattening \nof demand. In this sense, the sensitivity (which is equivalent to a discount of around 1,353,000 \nsq.m) is not carried forward as a preferred model. \nTable 4.10 Adjusted Gross Completions Trend Need 2023-46 (sq.m) \n \nAdjusted average \nannual gross \ncompletions \n(2012/13-23/24) \nRolled Forward \n(2023-46) \n5 year \nmargin \nTotal \nGross \ncompletions \n(2012-23) \n149,000 \n3,427,000 \n745,200 \n4,173,000 \nNB: Rounded to nearest 100 \nSource: Iceni Analysis of Council Monitoring Data  \nNet Absorption (Past Take-up) \n4.42 \nThe third model considers net absorption.

Ongoing supply shortages can deter inward \ninvestment and growth or divert it to other locations. \n4.45 \nUsing forecast trends for metrics such as completions and net absorption in markets where \nthere has been long term supply shortage can therefore potentially under-estimate future \ndemand, as the \u2018true\u2019 market demand is not reflected in historical trends.  \n4.46 \nIssues of suppressed demand are being advanced as an important consideration in forecasting \nindustrial and logistics needs by Savills and the British Property Federation. This is not \nhowever identified specifically in current Planning Practice Guidance.  \n4.47 \nIt is considered that typically a 5-10% availability level is needed for a healthy property market, \nto allow for occupiers to move into the market and existing occupiers to find new space or \nexpand. However for strategic units, an optimum availability may run lower than the 7.5% mid-\npoint, reflecting the scale of cost of development and risk associated with oversupply in the big \nbox segment.  \n4.48 \nThe figure below shows the historic availability rate (space advertised rather than vacant) and \nnet absorption. The graph indicates that for periods of lower availability there were lower rates \nof net absorption, signalling that demand may have been supressed. It shows that since 2012 \n\n\n \n62 \n \n \n \n \nthe availability rate was below 8% until 2022 and for some periods (2013-15, 2018) availability \nhas been below 5%. We would note that since 2019, availability has exceeded 5%. It is also \nnotable that in 2023 and 2024, whilst availability was strong, take-up was low, reflecting the \ninfluence of macro-economic factors on demand.  \nFigure 4.2 Leicestershire Strategic B8 Floorspace Net Absorption and Availability  \n \nSource: CoStar 2025 \n4.49 \nThe \u2018suppressed demand\u2019 model developed by Savills \u2018tops up\u2019 historic take up to where it \nwould have been with 8% availability in the past. Whilst the model is not established in Planning \nPractice Guidance, and has not been used in the preparation of Plan evidence, it is considered \nuseful as a sensitivity scenario where the market appears to have been consistently \nsuppressed over a number of years. It does assume that the market would have behaved \ndifferently with more availability, which may not necessarily be the case. In the context of \nstrategic B8, the supressed demand should be considered at a scale which reflects the market \narea that occupiers consider.  \n -\n 100,000\n 200,000\n 300,000\n 400,000\n 500,000\n 600,000\n 700,000\n 800,000\n0.0%\n2.0%\n4.0%\n6.0%\n8.0%\n10.0%\n12.0%\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2021\n2020\n2019\n2018\n2017\n2016\n2015\n2014\n2013\n2012\nAvailability Rate (%)\nFloorspace (sqm)\nNet Absorption\nAvailability\n5% Availability\n8% Availability\n\n\n \n63 \n \n \n \n \n4.50 \nFor the purpose of this report, the suppressed demand sensitivity has been run at a \nLeicestershire-wide level, however in reality occupiers unable to find an available unit in \nLeicestershire may consider the wider Golden Triangle market into the West Midlands, \nparticularly given the physical relationship for example of south Leicestershire \u2013 Magna Park \n\u2013 and the M6 corridor through Rugby and Coventry. Caution should therefore be exercised \nwith this sensitivity as the smaller the geographical area considered, the higher the risk that \nthe results are skewed.  \n4.51 \nSavills\u2019 preference for the availability \u2018target\u2019 is 8%. This is generally reasonable however for \nstrategic B8 units only (rather than the whole industrial market) this 8% may be optimistic, \npartly as build to suit rather than speculative build is more common for very large units. This \nleads to typically lower vacancy and potentially lower availability depending on marketing and \npre-let strategies. The costs to developers of over supplying the market for new build is more \nacute than for smaller / mid box units due to scale. As a result, both a 5% and 8% suppressed \ndemand scenario have been run as a sensitivity in this model.  \n4.52 \nThe table below shows the results. The details of the suppressed demand calculation are set \nout in Appendix A2. The supressed demand adjustment is applied to the net absorption model, \nhowever no 5-year margin is applied as the supressed demand adjustment captures future \nflexibility in the market through additional supply. These models indicate a need of 5.1 million \nsq.m under the 8% adjustment and 4.0 million sq.m under the 5% adjustment.  \nTable 4.12 Suppressed demand adjustment  \n \nAverage Suppressed \nDemand \nSupressed Demand \n(2023-46) \nNeed (2023-46): Net \nAbsorption \n+ \nSuppressed Demand \nSupressed Demand \n@ 8% \n59,400 \n1,366,300 \n5,069,600 \nSupressed Demand \n@ 5% \n14,300 \n328,400 \n4,031,700 \nSource: Iceni analysis of CoStar data, Savills methodology \n\n\n \n64 \n \n \n \n \nReplacement on Existing Sites \n4.53 \nThe above models consider gross demand for new-build development, where replacement of \nobsolete stock is a key demand driver. However, inevitably some future development to 2046 \nis likely to take place on existing brownfield sites; and in particular there is potential for recycling \nof large plots on well-located sites \u2013 which may have an older warehouse now, but where in \nsitu redevelopment could occur to deliver modern B8 floorspace.  \n4.54 \nIndeed an important component of demand for strategic units is driven by the need to replace \nolder stock. The MDST traffic growth and replacement models have a high replacement (30 \nyears) and low replacement (40 years) scenario. \n4.55 \nTaking a mid-point of these replacement scenarios (35 years), it is therefore assumed that \nunits built pre-2010 in Leicester and Leicestershire will become obsolete and need replacing \nduring the forecasting period. The 2021 Study relied on a high replacement scenario, which \nrequires replacement of pre-2006 stock and so this assumption remains broadly in line but \nrecognises that as a greater proportion of stock is increasingly newer, it will be built to more \nsustainable standards that should last for longer. \n4.56 \nWhere strategic units are in optimum locations (on existing logistics sites with strong strategic \nroad network access), this demand can potentially be satisfied in part through the \nredevelopment of sites to provide for new-build development.   \n4.57 \nIn this light, it is not appropriate to assume that all need forecasted under the gross completions \nmodel will need to be accommodated on new greenfield sites, nor would that be consistent \nwith the NPPF. It is quite reasonable to expect that some plots may support redevelopment to \ndeliver modern big box space to 2046. The NPPF in Para 126 emphasises that as much use \nas possible should be made of brownfield or previously developed land in accommodating \ndevelopment needs. Whilst examples of this in Leicestershire are limited at present, there are \nmany examples of (and opportunities for9) extensive refurbishment of older stock in optimum \n \n \n9 https://www.cbre.com/insights/briefs/availability-of-older-bulk-warehouses-presents-renovation-opportunities  \n\n\n \n65 \n \n \n \n \nlocations, however this is not monitored by planning authorities. Over the next decade and \nnotably beyond 2030, more certainty regarding in situ redevelopment is anticipated.   \n4.58 \nThe map below shows the location of strategic stock across L&L at a postcode level. Pre-2010 \nunits that are assumed will need replacing within the forecasting period are highlighted red. \nFigure 4.3 Pre-2010 and Post-2010 Strategic Stock \n \nSource: Iceni analysis of CoStar data 2025 \n\n\n \n66 \n \n \n \n \n4.59 \nNot all older units will be replaced in-situ, not least due to some being in sub-optimal locations. \nFor instance, Leicester has a significant proportion of aging stock within the urban area. In \nreality, these units are unlikely to be replaced on site by further strategic B8 development. \n4.60 \nIceni has identified indicatively the units that could be replaced on site as the site is optimally \nlocated on a strategic logistics site or has good access to the strategic road network \u2013 this \nprimarily includes East Midlands Gateway, Magna Park in Lutterworth, Bardon Hill or units \nwithin a 5-minute catchment of the M1, A42 and A5. These locations are shown in blue below. \n\n\n \n67 \n \n \n \n \nFigure 4.4 Pre-2010 Strategic Units \u2013 On-site Replacement \n \nSource: Iceni Projects analysis  \n4.61 \nThe table below shows that 2.6 million sq.m of strategic unit stock is dated pre-2010 and will \nbecome obsolete by the end of the forecasting period and therefore need replacing. This is \nequivalent to 52% of total stock across Leicestershire. Of the pre-2010 stock, 1.7 million sq.m \n\n\n \n68 \n \n \n \n \nis located in an optimum location and can be replaced on site \u2013 this is equivalent to 33.1% of \ntotal stock and 64.2% of pre-2010 stock. \nTable 4.13 Forecasted Replacement Rate of Strategic Units \n \nTotal Stock \nPre-2010 \nStock \nReplaced on site \nFloorspace \n% pre-2010 stock \nFloorspace \n4,995,500 \n2,574,400 \n1,652,000 \n64.2% \n% Total Stock \n \n51.5% \n33.1% \n \nSource: Iceni Analysis of CoStar data (2025) \n4.62 \nHowever some stock on good quality / optimum sites may be redeveloped for manufacturing \n/other uses; or split down into smaller units rather than being replaced for strategic logistics \nunits in situ; whilst some redevelopment may take at lower plot ratios than existing. We have \ntherefore adjusted downwards the contribution to supply from recycling of existing \nsites on this basis as a reasonable but cautious allowance and assume that the \nfloorspace yield is equivalent to 50% of pre-2010 stock. This is equivalent to 1,286,600 \nsq.m. This can be netted off from the overall need figure as a brownfield supply component.  \n4.63 \nThe process of this adjustment is shown in the figure below. It is necessary to take this into \naccount in particular in considering the gross completions projection and the traffic growth and \nreplacement model. The adjustment is not applied to the net absorption models as these \nintrinsically capture the replacement of older stock due to being a net trend (move ins \u2013 moves \nouts).  \n \n \n \n\n\n \n69 \n \n \n \n \nFigure 4.5 Site Recycling Methodology \n \nBringing the Strategic Unit Needs Evidence Together  \n4.64 \nTable 4.14 summarises the needs forecasted by all of the models.

Overall, Iceni considers that market-based \nmodels are more likely to represent future needs, taking into account dynamic changes in \nbusiness operations, premises needs and the strength of demand in this nationally important \nlocation. \n4.68 \nThe gross completions model has historically aligned more closely with the traffic growth \nand replacement demand model, however completions are now increasing above this model \nregardless of recycling assumptions. \n4.69 \nNet absorption models have been considered with varying rates of suppressed demand. The \nsuppressed demand considers how absorption (space occupied) may have performed \ndifferently with greater levels of historic space availability. Absorption adjusted for 5% \nsuppressed demand falls below completion rates, or in line with completions after accounting \nfor recycling. At 8% the highest level of need is generated.  \n4.70 \nIncorporated in the completions and traffic growth and replacement models is a land recycling \ncomponent. Taking a practical approach to best use of land, reflecting the NPPF (chapter 11), \nthe recycling of optimally placed sites is expected to become an opportunity over the next \ntwenty years.  \n4.71 \nOverall, it is recommended that the gross completions model including recycling is used \nfor strategic planning. This is because: \n\u2022 \nThe lower range of the replacement demand models do not align well to market signals, \nwhilst there is uncertainty regarding the market equilibrium inputs from the highest \nsuppressed demand models \n\u2022 \nThe preferred model broadly aligns with the suppressed demand at 5% model and is a \nmodel outcome that is broadly in the centre of all ranges provides a balanced position. \n\u2022 \nThe preferred model also allows for acknowledgement that COVID-19 period deliveries \nhave been much heightened, but that the market has cooled subsequently.  \n\n\n \n72 \n \n \n \n \n\u2022 \nIt includes a land recycling component, taking a practical approach to best use of land, \nreflecting the NPPF (chapter 11). \n4.72 \nOverall, this preferred model indicates that there is a need for 3,969,400 sq.m of net additional \nfloorspace for strategic B8 development over the 23-year forecast period. For reference the \n2021 study forecasted a need of 2,571,000 sq.m for a 21-year period (2020-41). The higher \nneed reflects the structural shift in the logistics market (as discussed in section 3) that has \noccurred since the 2021 study was completed.  \nRail-Served Requirement \n4.73 \nAs presented in table 4.3, around 17% of Leicestershire\u2019s floorspace capacity is currently \nlocated at a rail-served site (East Midlands Gateway and EMDC).  This is ahead of both the \nnational and regional position.  The national rail freight demand forecasts undertaken for \nNetwork Rail (as described) assumed that a much higher percentage would locate at a rail-\nserved site (Strategic Rail Freight Interchanges or SRFIs).  This was understood to be broadly \nin-line with recent planning consents in England and Wales for large scale warehousing at the \ntime the forecasts were produced.  Further, the planning system should now be making \nprovision for a much greater proportion of future large scale new-build to locate at rail-served \nsites across the region over the medium-long term.  This is due to the following reasons: \n1. National planning policy, principally the NPPF and the National Planning Statement for \nNational Networks, clearly expects large scale freight developments to be built at locations \nwhich have access to the railway network.  The NPS also concludes that there is a \u2018a \ncompelling need for an expanded network of SRFIs\u2019 \n2. The large growth rates that are forecast for intermodal rail freight, particularly on flows from \nthe deep-sea ports to the English Midlands and north of England, and the Government\u2019s long-\nterm target for at least 75% growth (all rail freight) up to 2050.   \n3. The ability to access cost competitive rail freight services is becoming a key commercial \nrequirement of the logistics industry, particularly for medium-longer distance trunk hauls \nbetween ports, NDCs and RDCs.   \n\n\n \n73 \n \n \n \n \n4. The de-carbonising agenda and the long-term need to de-carbonise road and rail freight is \nbecoming a key issue for the sector.  While the increasing use of rail freight has to date been \ndriven by cost, this will become the key driving factor going forward.  The development of \ncompetitive rail-linked strategic distribution sites is likely to be a crucial component in meeting \nthis requirement. \n4.74 \nThe 2021 Study recommended that 43% of strategic unit need should be rail-served, with the \nremaining 57% being met on road-served sites. This was derived as a mid-point between 26% \n(the National Rail 2018 forecasts10 of rail-served new-build warehousing) and 60% (the \nproportion of East Midlands stock over 250,000 sq.ft / 23,200 sq.m). \n4.75 \nMDS Transmodal have recommended three scenarios for consideration for rail served-\ndemand in Leicestershire: \n\u2022 \n17% - existing rail-served floorspace capacity in Leicestershire \n\u2022 \n34% - double the existing rail-served floorspace capacity in Leicestershire \n\u2022 \n64% - floorspace in units over 25,000 sq.m in East Midlands \n4.76 \nApplying a rail-served target to the future strategic B8 requirement is a policy-on approach and \ntherefore the optimal scenario applied is a policy judgement.  \n4.77 \nFor this study it is recommended that 34% rail-served scenario should be met, a reduction \nfrom the 2021 Study target of 43%. This proportion is still significantly above the National Rail \n26% forecast but reflects that the higher scenario should not be pursued given that a significant \namount of rail-served capacity has been recently delivered at East Midlands Gateway and East \nMidlands Distribution Centre. The table below splits the recommended strategic unit need \nderived by the completions model.  \n \n \n10 https://www.networkrail.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Rail-freight-forecasts-scenarios-for-2033-and-2043.pdf  \n\n\n \n74 \n \n \n \n \nTable 4.15 Road-Rail Split of Future Strategic Unit Requirements (2023-46) \n \nRail \u2013 34% \nRoad \u2013 66% \nTotal \nFloorspace (sq.m) \n1,349,600 \n2,619,800 \n3,969,400 \n4.78 \nSource: MDST, Iceni analysis, local authority monitoring \nSRFIs and Satellite Sites \n4.79 \nThe transfer of intermodal units (e.g. maritime containers) to and from distribution centres is a \nkey operational feature of an intermodal terminal.  The precise method and the associated \ncosts will vary depending on whether the warehouse is within the same estate as the \nintermodal terminal (i.e. within the SRFI) or is located \u2018off-site\u2019 and accessed using the public \nhighway network.  This ultimately has an impact on the commercial attractiveness of rail freight, \nparticularly in the context of the promotion of so-called satellite sites in local planning.  These \nsatellite sites are new B8 schemes located outside of an existing SRFI estate (where all plots \nare occupied and which will have reached its maximum expansion potential) but are in close \nproximity and able to take advantage of intermodal train services operating to/from the rail \nterminal.   \n4.80 \nWhere warehouses are located within close proximity to an intermodal terminal and are \nconnected by \u2018internal\u2019 estate roads which tend to be privately owned (e.g. at a port or SRFI \nsuch as East Midlands Gateway), containers are often transferred via short distance shunting \nmovements using yard tractors (aka \u2018tugs\u2019) and skeletal semi-trailer equipment.  Yard tractors \nare designed to haul semi-trailers away from the public road network, they are highly \nmanoeuvrable and can lift/drop trailers quickly and efficiently. \n4.81 \nInternal shunting operations within SRFIs would most likely adopt the \u2018drop trailer\u2019 method of \noperation.  A loaded container on a skeletal semi-trailer would be shunted from the rail terminal \nto its destination warehouse, and positioned at the appropriate loading dock.  The yard tractor \nwould then \u2018drop\u2019 the container/semi-trailer combination at the loading dock for discharge, and \nsubsequently collect an empty container/semi-trailer combination, ideally from another loading \ndock or nearby warehouse, before returning to the rail terminal. The yard tractor therefore \n\n\n \n75 \n \n \n \n \n\u2018keeps moving\u2019 and a round-trip out from and back to the rail terminal is able to shunt two \ncontainers. \n4.82 \nHowever, where the warehouse is located \u2018off-site\u2019 and accessed using the public highway \nnetwork, in normal circumstances road-legal tractor units (driven by qualified drivers) hauling \nskeletal semi-trailers have to be utilised.  Such an operation would normally see a road haulier \ncollect a container unit from the rail terminal and transport it to the destination warehouse.  The \nvehicle and driver will then wait with the container at the loading dock while it is discharged \nbefore returning it to the terminal (or repositioning for reloading with export traffic).  When \ncompared with yard tractors within a SRFI, the terminal to off-site warehouse transfer process \n(say East Midlands Gateway to the Leicester area) has the following disadvantages:  \n\u2022 \nDrivers need to possess a full (Class C+E) HGV drivers\u2019 licence (yard tractors on private \nland can be driven by un-licenced operatives).  Due to shortages and recruitment issues \nfor fully qualified drivers, wage rates are significantly higher; \n\u2022 \nRoad-legal HGV equipment is more expensive to purchase or lease when compared with \nyard tractors; \n\u2022 \nThe process of waiting for the container to be discharged means the equipment is utilised \nless intensively when compared with yard tractors; and \n\u2022 \nBuffer time has to be built into schedules to ensure \u2018just-in-time\u2019 delivery time-windows \n(which again reduces productivity) \n4.83 \nTaken together, these attract additional costs when compared with an internal \u2018drop trailer\u2019 \noperation. While yard tractors (as described) have been designed to haul semi-trailers on \nprivate land, under limited circumstances they can also be operated on the public highway \n(defined as roads maintained at public expense).  In these situations, they are classed as \n\u2018works trucks\u2019. When operated on the public highway, a works truck needs to be licenced with \nthe DVLA and pay Vehicle Excise Duty (VED).    \n4.84 \nTo benefit fully from being rail-served new warehouse schemes should ideally be located \nwithin SRFIs (either new SRFIs or the expansion of existing facilities), or at satellite sites which \n\n\n \n76 \n \n \n \n \ncan be within the \u2018immediate neighbourhood\u2019 and have the ability to utilise works trucks.  \nHowever, satellite sites slightly further afield could also benefit (say up to 15km round-trip) on \nthe basis that the more efficient \u2018drop-trailer\u2019 operating method could be adopted.  This is likely \nto be ideal for battery-electric HGVs given their need for \u2018top-up\u2019 charging.  The key caveat is \nthat the existing SRFI (which the satellite site feeds from) has a rail terminal already handling \ndaily trains from a number of origins (including the deep-sea container ports) and spare \ncapacity for growth.  \n4.85 \nThe 2021 Study split the strategic B8 floorspace requirement between road-served and rail-\nserved requirements. Previously rail-served floorspace referred explicitly to units located on a \nsite with a railhead, however within this report rail-served includes units on sites with a \nrailhead, sites with internal link roads and sites within a 5-mile drive distance from an \nexisting railhead. This captures the ability for a battery-electric HGV to complete a round-trip \nof 15km (9.3 miles).      \nMeeting the Rail-Served Need \n4.86 \nIn order to the meet the rail-served need, the below options should be prioritised as such: \n\u2022 \nExtension of existing rail-served sites (EMG); \n\u2022 \nDelivery of a new SRFI location; \n\u2022 \nSatellite sites within a 5-mile drive distance.  \n4.87 \nWhen considering the delivery of a new SRFI location, the 2021 warehousing study AOs \ninclude two corridors with rail potential outside of East Midlands Gateway, broadly being: \n\u2022 \nAO1 between Leicester and Hinckley, essentially following the M69 and Leicester-\nNuneaton train line (F2N Felixstowe to Nuneaton) transport corridors and part of M1; and  \n\u2022 \nAO2 \u2013 between Syston and Ratcliffe-on-Soar, broadly following the A6 and Midland Main \nLine (MML) as well as part of F2N route.  \n\n\n \n77 \n \n \n \n \n4.88 \nNeither of these AOs have railhead access at present and there are no alternative sites other \nthan Hinckley NRFI. Whilst the DCO application at Hinckley NRFI was refused, it should not \nbe dismissed as a potential SRFI location within this study. \n4.89 \nIt is outside of the scope of this study to provide a detailed assessment of potential alternative \nSRFI locations in Leicester and Leicestershire. However, the following high-level issues are \nidentified and broadly considered here regarding the two identified AO corridors and their ability \nto provide rail head access: \n1. That the rail network should have capacity for freight trains; \n2. That environmental constraints should not restrict the development potential; \n3. The road / rail routes are in close proximity, recognising that any rail head needs to be \naccessible by suitable roadway; \n4. That a potential railhead is reasonably accessible to the strategic road network (SRN); \n5. That the business case for the RFI is likely to be achievable, in terms of being at least c.20 \nmiles drive from an existing RFI. \n4.90 \nRegarding (1) the 2021 warehousing report indicates that AO2 (A6), as previously identified in \nthe 2016 report, was effectively predicated on the MML loading gauge being upgraded as it is \ncurrently not suitable to carry freight. The report notes that \u201cMost of the works planned have \neffectively been delayed indefinitely with no timescale for development or delivery\u201d (Table 2) \nand that \u201cthe Key Area of Opportunity B (Midland Main Line North corridor) identified in the \nSDS was effectively predicated on the MML loading gauge upgrade\u201d. This Key Area of \nOpportunity B was later renamed as AO2 being the A6 route. Overall, this indicates that for the \nforeseeable future, only the rail spur running north east at Syston is achievable for freight rather \nthan that running north west along the A6. Effectively, a SRFI at AO2 is not viable at this \ntime. \n\n\n \n78 \n \n \n \n \n4.91 \nSeparately, it is also recognised that as part of the HNRFI DCO application an alternative site \nassessment was undertaken11. That is not relied upon here, but it is of note that sites assessed \nonly follow the F2N route i.e. the rail spur running northeast at Syston. Notwithstanding the \noutcomes of that assessment, which concludes that the HNRFI location is preferred, it does \nsuggest that opportunities could be explored east of Syston (not currently an AO).   \nTable 4.16 Considerations for RFI opportunities  \nAO1 M69 / Leicester-\nNuneaton train line \nAO2 A6 / Midland Main Line \nRail network suitability \nSuitable. \nSuitable only in relation to F2N \nnot MML i.e. not along A6 parallel \nroute but potentially A46/A607 \nspur. \nLandscape constraint \ninfluences \nRelatively unconstrainted. \nFlood risk along much of the \nRiver Soar, less constrained \nsouth / east of Sileby. Flood risk \naround Syston following River \nWreake running towards Melton. \nRoad / rail proximity \nOther than M69 north of J2, \nrail line has reasonable \nproximity to M69 at Potters \nMarston but no M69 \njunction, then crosses \nB4114 west of Narborough; \nand M1 at Narborough / \nLittlethorpe although no M1 \nmotorway junction access. \nMML rail line has reasonable \nproximity to A6 (MRN) albeit \nseparated by River Soar. Also \nnears A46 / A607 around Sileby. \nF2N crosses A607 nr Syston and \nparallels A607 towards Melton.  \nSRN accessibility  \nM1 has national \nconnectivity as does M69 \nvia M1 / M6.  \nA46 is SRN, A6 / A607 MRN. A46 \nprovides a north / south link \nalthough south connection to M1 \nis relatively constrained via Hobby \nHorse roundabout. \nOther RFI proximity   \nLocated between EMG and \nDIRFT, suggests viable \nbusiness location. \nWithin EMG catchment, less \ncertainty on business case.  \n4.92 \nTaking into account the above, based on an initial assessment, it is unlikely that alternative \nSRFI locations are readily achievable as alternate locations to Hinckley NRFI. Other \nlocations are not wholly ruled out but may be suboptimal or require significant infrastructure \n \n \n11 HINCKLEY NATIONAL RAIL FREIGHT INTERCHANGE: Environmental Statement, Volume 1: Main Statement, \nChapter 4: Site selection and evolution, Document reference: 6.1.4 \n\n\n \n79 \n \n \n \n \nworks.

As a result, there is a need to consider \nlocational opportunities within the AOs and then draw conclusions back to the Area of \nOpportunity and District / Borough level.  \n6.3 \nFor road-based opportunities, broad locations have been identified with good transport links, \ncharacterised by junctions at motorway / A road locations. These are preferable broad \nlocations which could accommodate 25 ha+ allowing for viable development and infrastructure \ndelivery.  \n6.4 \nThe indicative scope of potential growth is informed by Iceni identified land parcels at suitable \nbroad locations and are supplemented by inclusion of LPA draft allocations and sites promoted \nthrough the call for sites, or other means. Some of these individual sites fall below the site size \nthreshold.  \n6.5 \nAll broad locations have then been tested for their relative suitability on a range of criteria.  \n6.6 \nFor rail based opportunities, the approach considers broad locations where there are \nopportunities for expansion at / within close proximity of existing rail terminals and then high \nlevel broad locations for alternative SRFIs in the study area. \n\n\n \n85 \n \n \n \n \nFigure 6.1: Broad Location Identification and Assessment  \n \n6.7 \nThis assessment should not be construed as providing an employment land availability \nassessment. It is strategic in nature and used to identify potential broad locations that could \naccommodate strategic warehousing / distribution development and prioritise broad locations \nthrough the assessment of broad planning and market factors. Further work will be necessary \nto inform the Local Plan process, including detailed transport assessments.  \nStage 1 \u2013 Define Areas of Search \n6.8 \nThe previous 2021 Warehousing Study identified 6 areas of opportunity\u2019, as seen in the figure \nbelow. \n1 Identify \nBroad \nLocations\n\u2022Focus on road network junctions as primary locations in AOs\n\u2022Defined as a buffer zone around transport corridors / SRFI (optimal 5-10 \nminute travel time from SRN junctions, 1km buffer from a B-road (i.e. \ndirectly at the junction).\n2 Filter \nland\n\u2022Remove land categorised as 'absolute constraint' as well as existing \nallocations and permissions\n3 Identify \nLand \nCapacity\n\u2022Identify unconstrained land parcels within the search parameters, including \nproposed or draft allocations and promoted sites (CfS)\n4 Assess \nBroad \nLocations\n\u2022Complete assessment for each broad location - assessing proximity to SRN, \njunction capacity, proxmimty to RFI, labour accessibility, public transport \naccess, spatial strategy and infrastructure requirements\n5 \nDeliverabi\nlity and \nPhasing\n\u2022Review access arrangements and junction capacity constraints through Highways \nAuthority engagement and identify corridor implications on deliverability and \nphasing.\n6 Rank\n\u2022Overall assessment of broad location and scoring \n\n\n \n86 \n \n \n \n \nFigure 6.2 Areas of Opportunity in Leicestershire \nSource: Warehousing and Logistics in Leicester and Leicestershire: Managing growth and \nchange (April 2021) \n6.9 \nThese areas broadly cover the Strategic Road Network (SRN) in Leicestershire, with the \nexception of the A6 which is not SRN, as below.  \nTable 6.1 Area of Opportunity: Strategic Road Network  \nArea of Opportunity \nRoads / Rail links SRFI  \nAO1 \nM69 (and A5 part, north) \nAO2 \nA6 and A46 (part)  \nAO3 \nM1/A50 interchange / East Midlands Gateway  \nAO4 \nM1 (north)  \n\n\n \n87 \n \n \n \n \nAO5 \nA42 \nAO6 \nM1 (south) and A5 (part, south) \n \n6.10 \nEngagement with market stakeholders (see Appendix A4) reported that road access is one of \nthe most important factors for strategic occupiers and it is typically a priority that they are \nlocated no more than a 5-minute drive from a motorway/major A-road junction, for the purpose \nof labour market access as well as speed of distribution.  \n6.11 \nTaking the above into account, the broad locations are defined as a buffer zone around the \nrelevant junctions listed in Table 6.2. The buffer zone is a 10-minute drive travel time from the \njunctions where the SRN junction connects to an A-road; and a 1km buffer where the junction \nconnects to a B-road, so that the location is effectively on the A Road junction access point \nrather than B Road. \n6.12 \nSome sites identified within this search area may have closer proximity to junctions not within \nthe list below but still fall within the buffer zone i.e. sites around Bardon will be attributed to M1 \nJ22 but accessed off the A511. \nTable 6.2 All Junctions within Areas of Opportunity \nArea of Opportunity \nJunctions \nAO1 \nM69 J1, M69 J2, A5/Logix Road, A5/Hammonds Way, A5/A47,  \nAO2 \n A6/William Railton Road, A6/A6004/Loughborough Road, \nA6/Barrow Road, A6/Granite Way, A6/Sileby Road, A6/Leicester \nRoad, A6/Cossington Lane/Loughborough Road, A6/A46, \nA6/Whatton Road/Zouch Road, A6/Bishop Meadow Road, \nA6/Lodge End, A6/A563 \nAO3 \nA50 J1, M1J24, A6/A453, M1J23A, A6/London Road \nAO4 \n M1 J23, M1 J22, M1J21A, M1 J21, A50/A46 \nAO5 \nA42 J11, A42 J12, A42 J13, A42 J14 \nAO6 \nM1 J20, M1 J19, A5/A426/Gibbet Lane, A5/A4303, A5/Mere Lane \n \n\n\n \n88 \n \n \n \n \nStage 2 \u2013 Junction Sift  \n6.13 \nIceni considered junction characteristics and ruled out a number of junctions ruled out in a first \nsift as follows: \nA.

Junctions in built up / residential areas which would not be suited to routing large volumes \nof HGV traffic (i.e. A6 / Leicester Road; A6 / William Railton Rd near Loughborough; A6 / \nWhatton Rd near Kegworth; A6 / A563 Leicester)  \n6.14 \nThe diagram below sets out the junctions included and the drive time areas. \n\n\n \n89 \n \n \n \n \nFigure 6.3 Map of all Junctions and 5 Minute Drive Time Isochrones \n \nStage 3 \u2013 \u2018Absolute Constraints\u2019 Filtered Out \n6.15 \nThe third stage was to \u2018filter out\u2019 any land within the areas of search that has an \u2018absolute \nplanning constraint\u2019. These are constraints which are considered to preclude land from B8 \ndevelopment. Using GIS software, land covered by these types of constraints was removed. \nThe \u2018absolute constraints\u2019 are: \n1) Environmental designations \u2013 SSSI, Special Area of Conservation, National and Local \nNature Reserve, Country Park, Ancient Woodland, National Forest Woodland; \n\n\n \n90 \n \n \n \n \n2) Flood zone 3b \u2013 functional floodplain; \n3) Heritage designations \u2013 Scheduled Monument (including archaeological sites), \nRegistered parks and gardens, Registered battle fields, Conservation Areas; \n4) Utilities \u2013 Overhead power lines, High pressure gas pipelines; \n5) Existing development (unless known to be poor quality or easily relocated); and \n6) Permissions, adopted housing / non-strategic employment allocations and Regulation 19 \nor later draft allocations for other land uses. \n6.16 \nNo Green Belt designations are applicable in the study area. Green Wedge does apply in some \nlocations in Leicester and Leicestershire however a \u2018policy off\u2019 approach to this assessment \nhas been agreed. \nHS2 Safeguarding has not been treated as an absolute constraint given the cancellation of \nPhase 2b in October 2023.  \nStage 4 \u2013 Potential Capacity \n6.17 \nLand was manually identified once the \u2018absolute constraints\u2019 were accounted for, to identify \nadditional opportunity sites that have not been promoted for B8 development to the \nLeicestershire local authorities in addition to identifying the maximum land capacity in the \nlocation of promoted / draft allocated sites.  \n6.18 \nWhen identifying land, physical boundaries such as roads and rivers were taken into account, \nbut land ownership was not. For the purpose of this exercise, it is assumed that land assembly \nwould be possible. This is appropriate given the high-level nature of the assessment. \n6.19 \nBased on stakeholder discussions, particularly with developers, it was assumed that a \nminimum of 25ha would be needed for new sites and 10ha when the site is an extension of an \nexisting distribution park. For the purpose of the land parcels identified by Iceni, a 25ha \nthreshold was considered the typical minimum to generate sufficient value to support the \ndelivery of enabling infrastructure. \n\n\n \n91 \n \n \n \n \n6.20 \nFollowing this, additional sites not identified in this process were provided by local authorities \nincluding: \n\u2022 \nDraft allocations (Regulation 18) \n\u2022 \nDraft allocations (Regulation 19) \n\u2022 \nAny further Call for Sites or other promoted proposals (for strategic B8) \n6.21 \nThese authority evidence based sites were not subject to the same parcel size threshold as \nthe Iceni land capacity search. It is assumed that where sites have fallen below the threshold, \nas these are promoted, that they are viable and deliverable with sufficient infrastructure already \nin place. \n6.22 \nThe Hinckley NRFI site has also been included for assessment to provide an assessment of \nthe broad location. \n6.23 \nThe table below lists the broad locations identified and associated land capacity that will \nprogress to assessment. A maximum floorspace capacity has also been derived using an \nindicative 0.35 plot ratio, or where known, more specific floorspace capacity \u2013 such as proposal \nat Hinckley NRFI and south of East Midlands Airport12. \n6.24 \nIceni view an indicative plot ratio of 0.35 as appropriate and in line with other evidence base \ndocuments such as the West Midlands Strategic Employment Sites Study 2024 and recent \ndevelopments. A plot ratio of 0.35 refers to the gross developable area and does not include \nelements such as country parks and external roads but includes internal roads and on-site \nlandscaping.  \n6.25 \nPlot ratios can be influenced by a number of factors, including landscape and visual mitigation, \nBNG requirements and SuDS \u2013 these are all site specific and therefore plot ratios will differ \nsite by site. For the purpose of this study, which is high-level in nature and emphasises the \n \n \n12 Pending application  \n\n\n \n92 \n \n \n \n \nimportance of further testing of capacity and site specifics, an indicative plot ratio of 0.35 is \ndeemed appropriate and in line with efficient land use as required by the NPPF. The \napportionment methodology in Section 7 is designed to flexibly respond to changing \nassumptions around capacity within broad locations.  \n\n\n \n93 \n \n \n \n \nTable 6.3 Broad Locations Identified for Assessment \nBroad Location / Junction \nMaximum Land \nCapacity (Ha) \nMaximum Floorspace \nCapacity (sq.m) \nLocal Authority \nAO \nSouth of EMA \n8513 \n240,00014 \nNWL \nAO3 \nA50 J1 \n65 \n227,500 \nNWL \nAO3 \nSouth of Kegworth \n140 \n490,000 \nNWL \nAO3 \nM1 J23 \n23 \n80,500 \nCharnwood \nAO4 \nM1 J22 \n30 \n105,000 \nBlaby \nAO4 \nBardon \n65 \n227,500 \nNWL/H&B \nAO4 \nM69 J2 \n290 \n650,00015 \nBlaby \nAO1 \nA5 (North) \n60 \n210,000 \nH&B \nAO1 \nMagna Park (A5 South) \n150 \n525,000 \nHarborough \nAO6 \nM1 J20 \n190 \n665,000 \nHarborough \nAO6 \nA42 J11 \n260 \n910,000 \nNWL \nAO5 \nA42 J12 \n100 \n350,000 \nNWL \nAO5 \nA42 J13 \n110 \n385,000 \nNWL \nAO5 \nA42 J14 \n240 \n840,000 \nNWL \nAO5 \nA46/A50 \n110 \n385,000 \nBlaby / H&B \nAO4 \nA46/A607 \n45 \n157,500 \nCharnwood \nAO2 \n \n \n13 Total site of 105ha, proposals for 20% of floorspace attributed to B2  \n14Total floorspace 300,000 sq.m; 80% B8 https://www.segro.com/countries-repository/united-kingdom/segro-logistics-park-east-midlands-gateway-2/emerging-proposal  \n15 As per Hinckley NRFI DCO application excl. mezzanine  \n\n\n \n94 \n \n \n \n \n6.26 \nThe locations are pictured on the map below.

National Highways were \noriginally engaged with in Spring 2023, however it should be noted that a comprehensive \nupdate has been declined by National Highways in 2025.  \n6.35 \nThis section provides a high-level overview of the transport authorities\u2019 views on transport \ncapacity and infrastructure requirements for each of the broad locations to feed into the overall \nassessment. Further transport modelling and testing will form part of the Local Plan process to \ntest sites in more detail.  \n6.36 \nCounty and National Highways feedback can be found in Appendix 5. The below highlights the \nheadline issues: \n\u2022 \nA5 \u2013 see below in more detail; \n\u2022 \nM1 J23A/ J24 \u2013 Junction has been upgraded however there are still congestion issues \nand challenges in delivering further mitigation. Significant highways works required to \nfacilitate further growth at this location; \n\u2022 \nA50 J1 \u2013 known capacity constraints; \n\u2022 \nM1 J20 - issues of connections with local road network, A4303 and route to Magna Park. \nFurther growth at this location should be considered in conjunction with Lutterworth East \nSDA; \n\u2022 \nM1 J21 interchange: significant congestion at Leicester access point; \n\u2022 \nM1 J22 - constraints feeding into Bardon Hill area despite National Highway \nimprovements; \n\u2022 \nM1 J23 - Loughborough - further housing growth planned, study currently underway to \nreview mitigation required; \n\n\n \n97 \n \n \n \n \n\u2022 \nA50/A46 \u2013 A46 operates at or close to capacity in this area, further impacted by capacity \nand safety issues on M1 J21a to J21. Further growth at this location reported to result in \nfurther unacceptable diversions of traffic away from A46 and M1 and on to lower order \nroads running through local communities; \n\u2022 \nA6 - inclusion in the study is considered an anomaly as it is not a strategic road and serves \nthe local population, part is single carriageway; \n\u2022 \nA42 \u2013 no major capacity issues however corridor is limited to two lanes. A42 J14 only has \nwestbound slip roads \u2013 it is unlikely that additional junction arms would be delivered at this \nlocation; \n\u2022 \nM69 J2 \u2013 strategic B8 growth cannot be accommodated at this location that utilises the \nmotorway junction without the delivery of south facing slip roads, as proposed under \nprevious HNRFI DCO; and \n\u2022 \nA46/A607 (Hobby Horse Roundabout) - Hobby Horse roundabout is the most congested \nand delayed junction in the corridor. National Highways reported that the roundabout could \nonly be resolved via a major projects intervention and not through developer contributions \nor mitigation scheme inputs. There is currently no planned improvements to this junction. \n6.37 \nThe above comments highlight the scale of challenge, and level of infrastructure investment \nrequired in Leicestershire. Whilst this may be considered prohibitive to growth, in relation to \nthis work, it also sets out the scale of the economic opportunity associated with investment, if \nsuitable schemes can be designed and funded. \n6.38 \nThese network issues are pre-existing and as such, the scale of investment requirement to \nresolve these issues is well beyond what would be required to mitigate the impact of new \ngrowth alone. Although, it is accepted that the investment requirement to mitigate the impacts \nof growth may provide some betterment, especially if investment can be coordinated with future \nNational Highways improvements.  \n \n\n\n \n98 \n \n \n \n \nA5 \n6.39 \nThe A5 corridor is largely at capacity for much of the section within Warwickshire and \nLeicestershire. Issues are particularly exacerbated at single carriageway sections which are \npredominantly west of the M69 interchange (A5 North). There is currently no strategy in place \nfrom National Highways to provide the necessary infrastructure improvements. Significant \nS106 contributions have been made to National Highways for the previous phases of Magna \nPark expansion (A5 South) but no improvements have been implemented given a strategy / \nscheme is not in place for development. \n6.40 \nWithout a strategy in place, there is a risk that growth along the corridor is not being managed \n\u2013 individual schemes are coming through the planning system providing \u2018patchwork\u2019 \nimprovements. This may sterilise land and limit improvements that can be made in the longer \nterm.  \n6.41 \nUncertainty around infrastructure investment has been a long-term historical issue with \nschemes announced by the government and then cancelled \u2013 notably commitment for dualling \ninclusion in RIS 3. \n6.42 \nRecent WCC Highways comments confirmed that further growth in the Magna Park area is \ndependent on the need for strategy scale interventions on the A5 corridor, at least at the Cross \nin Hand and Gibbet Hill Roundabouts16.  \n6.43 \nInvestment along the A5 (and the SRN in general) is likely required in the long-term to deal \nwith existing issues, regardless of the scale of growth required. It is therefore reasonable to \nassume a that a degree of investment in the SRN will come forward to address some of the \nexisting capacity issues in the long-term, within the 20-year study horizon, unlocking further \ncapacity for growth.  \n \n \n16 Harborough District Council Local Plan Regulation 19 Consultation, Warwickshire County Council Transport Planning Team \nComments, 30th April 2025 \n\n\n \n99 \n \n \n \n \nTransport Summary \n6.44 \nThis study is limited in scope and therefore not able to undertake any modelling, and Iceni thus \nrelying on officer / stakeholder feedback. Judgements are required in terms of dealing with \njunction inclusion for suitability and infrastructure investment. \n6.45 \nIt is recognised that with sufficient investment scale, some of the congestion issues could be \novercome. This is evident for example with regard to the previous HNRFI DCO at M69 J2 as \nthe significant scale of development provides for investment (and funding) to add junction \narms; or major National Highways investment on the A5.  However, it is beyond the scope of \nthis study to examine detailed issues of junction and network capacity, including cumulative \nimpacts, infrastructure requirements and associated costs and viability testing of proposals. \nThere are also potential implications of major infrastructure works to junctions on the timing of \ndelivery of associated development.  \nOverall Assessment \n6.46 \nAll of the above variables are brought together in an overall assessment of each broad location. \nThe overall assessment involves a level of Iceni\u2019s professional judgement.

The most recent comparable example is \nthat for the West Midlands Strategic Employment Sites Study 202418 which: \n\u2022 \nIdentifies capacity at motorway junctions; \n\u2022 \nIdentifies and scores junctions on a series of criteria, removing red flagged junctions;  \n\u2022 \nAreas of opportunity are identified around the remaining scored junctions; and \n\u2022 \nThe residual need is apportioned to areas of opportunity based on (i) market factors, (ii) \nyears of committed supply, (iii) relative size of the area, (iv) proximity to SRFIs and (v) \nGreen Belt constraints.  \n7.3 \nA methodology has been developed for this report. Whilst it is acknowledged that there are \nsimplistic ways in which this apportionment could be done, i.e. sharing out \u2018need\u2019 following the \nproportion of past completions or stock holdings \u2013 this would fail to recognise potential land \nsupply constraints; and assumes past trends are the most sustainable approach in land use \nplanning terms, which may not be the case.  \n7.4 \nThe methodology has been designed specifically to: \n\u2022 \nReflect the level of detail available at the time of the report and the scale and scope of the \nbrief; \n \n \n18 https://www.hwa.uk.com/site/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/WMSESS-Final-Report-Phase-3-Aug-2024.pdf  \n\n\n \n108 \n \n \n \n \n\u2022 \nEnable a hierarchy of outcomes, so that the most suitable locations can be identified for \nthe purpose required; and \n\u2022 \nUse a sequential approach, meaning that should new information come to light about any \nlocation assessed, or indeed location rejected, the outcomes can be adjusted. \n7.5 \nThe assessment considers the apportionment to areas of opportunity (corridors). It is for \nindividual local plan processes to assess and identify specific site allocations. \nOverview  \nFigure 7.1 Approach to Apportionment  \n \nJustifying the approach \n7.6 \nThe approach seeks to provide a practical and transparent way of dealing with apportionment \nsequentially and a method that has longevity as it can be adapted to reflect new information \navailable in the future. This includes focusing on AOs and broad locations rather than individual \n1\n\u2022Derive a target split by Area of Opportunity, prioritising rail opportunities and \nmarket ranking of AOs\n2\n\u2022Apportion floorspace required across the AOs based on the target split to derive a \ntotal floorspace requirement by AO. Net off commitments in each AO, providing the \nrequirement to be met through additional supply.\n3\n\u2022Road / Rail Split: Identify rail-based opportunities. Meet residual requirement on \nroad-based sites. \n4\n\u2022Check AO capacity (Green and Amber Broad Locations) against target split \n5\n\u2022Where insufficient capacity, reapportionment residual requirement by using target \nsplit - reweighted as broad locations reach maximum capacity. \n6\n\u2022Check phasing of apportionment - ensuring more than one broad location can come \nforward at a time\n\n\n \n109 \n \n \n \n \nsites. Due to the scale and scope of the work some issues are dealt with on limited information, \nbut this is not considered to prejudice the overall approach.  \n7.7 \nThe approach apportions the need to Areas of Opportunity. It is the role of Local Plan \npreparation processes within LPAs to consider specific allocations and test infrastructure \ncapacity which may influence the scale and particularly the phasing of growth. This could lead \nto future iterations of the distribution of floorspace across AOs and districts.  \n7.8 \nThe study recognises the potential for investment in junctions and infrastructure to support \ndevelopment over the period to 2046 and the potential implications on phasing. \nRail-Served Opportunities \n7.9 \nWhilst the road-rail split of the identified strategic warehousing need is a policy choice, growth \nat rail-served locations should be prioritised. As detailed in section 4, the planning system \nshould be making provision for a greater provision of rail-served sites due to national planning \npolicy identifying need for an expanded network of SRFIs; the Government\u2019s rail freight growth \ntarget; growing demand for cost competitive rail freight services between ports and NDCs and \nthe decarbonising agenda within the logistics sector.  \n7.10 \nSection 5 identifies a rail-based shortfall of 1,349,600 sq.m. This need can be met at a new \nstrategic rail freight interchange, through expansion of existing railhead sites, or following this, \non satellite sites within a 5 mile drive distance (as per Section 5).  \n7.11 \nWhilst the Hinckley NRFI DCO decision was refused, the potential for a new rail freight \ninterchange to be delivered at this location within the study period, should not be dismissed. \nThe decision letter19 agrees that there is a compelling need for the Proposed Development. \nThe DCO application was refused on the basis most notably of insufficient transport modelling \nevidence assessing the impacts at M1 J21/M69 J3; non-compliance with the road safety \n \n \n19https://infrastructure.planninginspectorate.gov.uk/wp-content/ipc/uploads/projects/TR050007/TR050007-002725-\nRefusal%20Letter%20-%20Hinckley%20NRFI.pdf  \n\n\n \n110 \n \n \n \n \nrequirements; and the highways safety impacts on the village of Sapcote as a result of the \nHGV re-routing allowing the slip roads to be constructed. \n7.12 \nWhilst not undermining the scale of the issues for refusal, it is Iceni\u2019s view that it is likely a \nfurther application for the SRFI at Hinckley could be submitted and be consented through the \nDCO process, rather than the Local Plan or Local Planning Authority development \nmanagement route. The development could therefore still come forward within the study period \nto 2046. This aligns with National planning policy, principally the NPPF and the National \nPlanning Statement for National Networks, which clearly expects large scale freight \ndevelopments to be built at locations which have access to the railway network.   \n7.13 \nBased on the previous plans, there is capacity for 650,000 sq.m of floorspace to be delivered \nat the Hinckley NRFI site.  \n7.14 \nEMG is the only operating railhead in Leicestershire. At the time of this study, Maritime are \nonly operating 4 out of a capacity of 16 trains a day from East Midlands Gateway (and East \nMidlands Distribution Centre does not currently operate its railhead, which is leased only to \nM&S). In rail side terms, there is therefore significant capacity for increased train frequency. In \nterms of delivering additional land side capacity, which is effectively the function of the \u2018need\u2019 \nrequirement, it is logical that locations closest to this railhead are prioritised for development. \n7.15 \nNot all occupiers use the rail facility, but this could change over time. At current rail capacity, it \nis assumed that considerable further development could occur around EMG without saturating \nrail side capacity, notwithstanding issues on the road network or potentially other impacts \nincluding increased labour market demand.  \n7.16 \nThere are emerging proposals for East Midlands Gateway 2 within the South of EMA broad \nlocation which includes multi-unit logistics/industrial development alongside improvements to \nthe efficiency and freight handling functionality of the existing SRFI at EMG120. Proposals \n \n \n20 Statement of Community Consultation - https://www.segro.com/countries-repository/united-kingdom/segro-logistics-park-east-\nmidlands-gateway-2  \n\n\n \n111 \n \n \n \n \ninclude rail head site access from the A433 and potential improvements to the wider highway \nnetwork. These proposals support the principle that strategic B8 development at this location \nwill be rail-served.  \n7.17 \nThe capacity assessment identifies 240,000 sq.m (85ha) of capacity within the South of EMA \nbroad location, recognising that of the total 300,000 sq.m proposed on the 105ha site, 20% of \nthis will provide for B2 uses. This should be relied upon in full to contribute towards the rail-\nserved need.  \nTarget Apportionment \n7.18 \nOne of the recommendations from the 2021 report was that \u201callocations ensure a supply of \nvacant plots at strategic sites in at least two of the Areas of Opportunity simultaneously ideally \nacross road and rail\u201d (p139). In this light, a preferred apportionment strategy (target split) has \nbeen derived based on the market ranking of areas of opportunity and the locations of the \nidentified rail-served locations. \n7.19 \nThe table below derives a target apportionment of the additional floorspace requirement.  \n7.20 \nStep 1 starts with an equal split across the five Areas of Opportunity that have broad locations \nidentified and capacity. No broad locations or land parcels were identified in AO2 and it is \ntherefore discounted from the apportionment approach from here onwards. \n7.21 \nA market ranking has been derived for each Area of Opportunity, this market ranking fed into \nthe assessment of broad locations and is discussed further in appendix A6. \n7.22 \nStep 2 adjusts the target split upwards or downwards based on market ranking and the \nopportunities to meet a rail-based need. \n7.23 \nThe apportionment is uplifted to 25% within AO1 (M69) and AO3, recognising the rail-based \nopportunities as noted above and the prime market locations of both areas. No further \nadjustment are made to AO4 (M1 North) and AO6 (M1 South), reflecting that they are prime \nmarket locations but with no rail-based opportunities.  \n\n\n \n112 \n \n \n \n \n7.24 \nAO5 (A42) sees a downwards adjustment to 10%, recognising that it is a secondary location, \nparticularly given its lower labour market availability and non-motorway status.  \nTable 7.1 Target Apportionment by AO \n \nBroad \nLocations \nStep 1: \nEqual Split \nMarket Rank \ndesignation \nStep 2: \nAdjusted Split \nTarget \nApportion-\nment \nAO1 \u2013 \nM69/A5 \nM69 \n20% \n1 \nAdjusted \nupwards: rail \nprioritisation \n+5% \n25% \nA5 (North) \nAO2 \u2013 A6 \nN/A \n0% \n3 \nUnadjusted \n0% \nAO3 \u2013 \nEMG \nSouth of \nEMA \n20% \n1 \nAdjusted \nupwards: rail \nprioritisation \n+5% \n25% \nA50 J1 \nKegworth \nAO4 \u2013 M1 \nNorth \nM1 J23 \n20% \n1 \nUnadjusted \n20% \nM1 J22 \nBardon \nAO5 \u2013 \nA42 \nA42 J11 \n20% \n2 \nAdjusted \ndownwards: low \nmarket ranking \n-10% \n10% \nA42 J12 \nA42 J13 \nAO6 \u2013 M1 \nSouth \nMagna \nPark (A5 \nSouth) \n20% \n1 \nUnadjusted \n20% \nM1 J20 \n \n7.25 \nThe table below apportions the additional floorspace required (3,969,400 sq.m) based on the \ntarget apportionment and nets off the existing completions and commitments to derive a \nresidual floorspace required.  \n\n\n \n113 \n \n \n \n \n7.26 \nIt is of note that 206,100 sq.m of completions/commitments are located outside of the AOs. \nThis is taken account of prior to the apportionment of the additional floorspace and does not \ndistort the target apportionment21. \n7.27 \nThe residual floorspace requirement is met through the rail-based locations in AO1 and AO3, \nas discussed in detail above, yielding 890,000 sqm of floorspace at rail-served sites. There are \nno further direct rail head connected locations identified within Leicestershire. As a result, the \nremaining requirement of 2,169,200 sq.m is assumed to all be met on road-based sites.  \n \n \n21 206,100 sq.m is netted off from 3,969,400.

This is based on infrastructure investment \nrequirements based on engagement feedback from County Highways, proposed and draft \nallocations.  \n7.33 \nIn the short-term the need is met by the 2023/24 completions and extant commitments. \n7.34 \nThe phasing of each of the areas of opportunity are considered in turn below: \n\u2022 \nAO1 (M69 / A5 North):  \no Hinckley NRFI: Taking into account the lead in time for a new DCO application \nto be submitted and assessed it assumed that development would come \nforward in the medium to long term, no earlier than 2033; \no A5 North: There are significant network capacity constraints along the A5 \ncorridor, which cannot be addressed in full through developer improvements \nor contributions. Major infrastructure investment is required through a National \nHighways scheme, however no scheme has been identified to date. RIS 3 \ncurrently covers the period to 2030 and so for the purpose of this study it \nassumed that the necessary infrastructure improvements are to be brought \nforward beyond 2030 (medium to long-term). Proposed allocations in this \nlocation have been included in Hinckley and Bosworth Regulation 18 indicating \nsome level of growth will be accommodated within their plan period (to 2045).   \n\u2022 \nAO3 (EMG) \no South of EMA (EMG2): It is understood that with the necessary highways \nworks, development of a second phase at East Midlands Gateway can be \n\n\n \n118 \n \n \n \n \naccommodated in the medium term given current junction capacity without \nmajor infrastructure intervention. \no A50 J1 / South of Kegworth: Assuming that rail-served growth is prioritised and \nthe above comes forward first, feedback from County Highways indicated that  \nfurther capacity would need to  be provided at M1 J23A/J24, likely requiring \nNational Highways intervention \u2013 given this, growth at this location is phased \nas a medium to long term (2033+); \n\u2022 \nAO4 (M1 North): It is understood that growth at the identified broad locations can be \nbrought forward in the medium term with the necessary highways works and do not \nrequire significant National Highways investment. At M1 J22 there is a proposed \nallocation (Hinckley and Bosworth Regulation 18) \n\u2022 \nAO5 (A42): It is understood that growth at the identified broad locations can be brought \nforward in the near medium term with the necessary highways works and do not \nrequire significant National Highways investment. \n\u2022 \nAO6 (M1 South / Magna Park): Apportionment requires 1-2 broad locations to come \nforward.  \no Magna Park: Extension to Magna Park draft allocation (Harborough Regulation \n19) \u2013 assumed it will come forward in plan period (before 2041) - medium-term  \no M1 J20: Further growth to meet apportioned need to come forward potentially \nbeyond Harborough plan period - long-term. \n7.35 \nThe phasing plan below shows that strategic B8 growth would come forward in more than one \nlocation at a time in line with the recommendations of the 2021 Study.

This work does not prejudice \nthe development of individual Local Plans which will undertake more detailed testing of \nlocations and sites, including transport assessments as well as housing and employment \nspatial interrelationships.  \nAssessment of need \n8.3 \nThe assessment of need in this report looks at a range of approaches including completion \ntrends, market absorption, issues of suppressed demand, traffic growth forecasts with \nreplacement demand and matters of potential site recycling.  \n8.4 \nAcross the assessments Iceni recommends that the gross completions trend, with some \nadjustments for potential future site recycling, is used. This amounts a need of 3,969,400 sq.m \n(before taking account of the 2023/24 completions and commitments as of April 2024 totalling \nc.910,200 sq.m). \nMethod of Apportionment  \n8.5 \nThe approach to apportionment can be summarised as: \n\u2022 \nIdentification of potential broad locations for future strategic distribution floorspace using \nspecific search parameters, including minimum site size, constraints and proximity to the \nSRN; \n\u2022 \nFurther cross check and inclusion of sites included in emerging Local Plans and call for \nsites or promoted submissions; \n\u2022 \nAssessment and ranking of broad locations; \n\n\n \n123 \n \n \n \n \n\u2022 \nDerive a target apportionment: prioritising the expansion of rail-served sites / delivery of a \nnew SRFI and reflecting market ranking; \n\u2022 \nApportion the additional floorspace requirement using the target apportionment, net off \ncompletions/commitments and consider rail-based locations first, meeting the residual \nrequirement at road-based locations \n\u2022 \nTest to target apportionment against assessed land capacity, re-apportioning the shortfall \nto areas with capacity using a re-weighted target split; \n\u2022 \nChecking distribution and phasing of apportionment outcomes. \nApportionment outcomes \n8.6 \nThe table below reports on the overall apportionment results at the AO level. This is the primary \nspatial area for the apportionment of needs as it reflects corridors of land where locations are \nconcentrated and grouped around infrastructure.  \nTable 8.1 Apportionment by AO (sq.m) \nDistrict \nCompletions + \nCommitments \nResidual Need \nApportioned \nTotal \nApportioned \nNeed \nApportio\nnment \n(%) \nRail \nRoad \nRoad \nRail \n \n \nAO1 \n- \n          \n31,700  \n           \n210,000  \n          \n650,000  \n                \n891,700  \n22% \nAO2 \n- \n          \n-    \n           \n-    \n-  \n                \n-    \n0% \nAO3 \n- \n          \n138,600  \n           \n650,600 \n          \n240,000  \n                \n1,029,200  \n26% \nAO4 \n- \n          \n194,300  \n           \n413,000  \n - \n                \n607,300  \n15% \nAO5 \n- \n          \n82,500  \n           \n329,200  \n - \n                \n411,700  \n10% \nAO6 \n- \n          \n257,000  \n           \n566,400  \n - \n                \n823,400  \n21% \nOther \n- \n          \n206,100  \n           \n-    \n - \n                \n206,100  \n5% \nTotal \n- \n          \n910,200  \n           \n2,169,200  \n          \n890,000  \n                \n3,969,400  \n \nSource: Iceni analysis \n\n\n \n124 \n \n \n \n \n8.7 \nThe table below reports on the overall apportionment results at the district / borough level, \ndrawing on the site assessment and apportionment outcomes.

Whilst this may be considered prohibitive to \ngrowth, in relation to this work it also sets out the scale of the economic opportunity associated \nwith investment if suitable schemes can be designed and funded. \nLongevity and reflexivity of outcomes  \n8.9 \nThe approach in this study is designed to have longevity in its application, which is not to say \nthat the outcomes of the methodology are fixed.  \n8.10 \nThe methodology is applied using currently available information. It is liable to change as Local \nPlans progress and more information is available about individual locations and sites, both \nthose assessed and rejected, including (but not exclusively) site capacity,  land availability and \ntransport capacity. \n\n\n \n125 \n \n \n \n \n8.11 \nThe outcomes and quantitative recommendations in this report are not absolute - they provide \na guide for further feasibility and testing for individual allocations or applications as seen fit by \nthe authorities. In particular, detailed work will need to be undertaken through the Local Plan \nmaking process, in the case of Hinckley NRFI, the DCO process, across issues such as land \navailability, landscape, biodiversity, and transport assessment and modelling. Strategic \nTransport Assessment and/or Local Plan Transport Assessment will be required to take the \nsites considered and overall apportionment forward to allocation stage and support the \nselection of appropriate site/s to meet identified needs. This report does not usurp Local Plan \nmaking or the DCO process but is intended as a reasonable approach to apportioning the need \nof strategic distribution prior to further assessment through the Plan making process.  \n8.12 \nThe methodology is designed as such that it can be readily updated as required when \ncircumstances change to reflect new information, constraints or developments.  \nLimitations \n8.13 \nLimitations of this report include: \n\u2022 \nThe feasibility of locations has been tested through a high-level consideration of land \nsuitability based on environmental designations, infrastructure and land use. Designations \nprovided by the authorities have been relied upon. The availability and deliverability of \nsites has not been tested in detail. \n\u2022 \nThat some professional judgement - subjectivity - is involved in the weighting of factors \nand making overall site assessment outcomes, as well as reflections on the capacity of \nAOs / corridors.  \n\u2022 \nThe transport and infrastructure capacity has been primarily based on desktop reviews of \ncurrent traffic (Google) and engagement with the highways authorities. No modelling has \nbeen undertaken. The potential cost / viability of infrastructure and upgrades has not been \nexplored. Some potential development locations have therefore been ruled out on the \nbasis of inadequate infrastructure, and significant development may have the potential to \novercome this. Equally, a number of locations that the highways authorities have raised \n\n\n \n126 \n \n \n \n \nas being effectively \u2018at capacity\u2019 have been included and therefore the level of mitigation \nrequired for future development may be significant. \n\u2022 \nDetailed site allocations are expected to be explored through the preparation of individual \nLocal Plans, or in the case of Hinckley NRFI, through the DCO process. It will be for LPAs \nto consider these recommendations in conjunction with their detailed appraisal of sites \nincluding localised transport modelling and assessments of landscape, biodiversity, land \navailability etc, through their Local Plans. This report therefore does not seek to pre-empt \nor replace either the Local Plan process or the DCO consenting route but is intended to \nprovide strategic guidance on the reasonable spatial distribution of future strategic \nlogistics needs. \n\n\n \n127 \n \n \n \n \nA1. POLICY REVIEW \u2013 STRATEGIC SITES / LOGISTICS STUDIES \nWest Midlands Strategic Sites Study (2024) (WMSESS) \nA1.1 \nFor reference a brief overview of the WMSESS 2024 has been included below, to draw on \nthe methodology to quantifying and apportioning the need for employment sites of a strategic \nscale across a regional area.  \nA1.2 \nThe study considered three main models \u2013 MDS Transmodal Traffic Growth and \nReplacement Demand; Completions; and Net Absorption. Several sensitivities were also \napplied to the models which included a supressed demand adjustment, margin for flexibility \nand the capacity for recycling brownfield sites. \nA1.3 \nLand parcels within 5 minute drive time of strategic road junctions were capacity tested and \nscored across a number of metrics: junction capacity, labour accessibility by car, labour \naccessibility by public transport and distance to a rail freight interchange. \nA1.4 \nAreas of opportunity were then identified around junctions with land capacity and based on \nmarket signals and intelligence. The residual need was apportioned by area of opportunity \nby considering a number of factors to balance the shortfall in supply: \n\u2022 \nMarket rank; \n\u2022 \nSize of area of opportunity; and \n\u2022 \nNumber of year supply \u2013 based on past take-up rates \nA1.5 \nIt was assumed that there was an indicative site capacity for 25ha of B2 sites and 50ha for \nB8/mixed sites. \n\n\n \n128 \n \n \n \n \nFigure A1.1 WMSESS Areas of Opportunity and Capacity Tested Junctions \n \nSource: WMSESS 2024, Iceni Projects \nA1.6 \nRail based opportunity areas were identified through locating where appropriately freight \ngauge cleared railway lines coincide with the strategic highway network. Detailed site \nassessments for these broad areas were not undertaken as part of the study.  \nNottinghamshire Core & Outer HMA Logistics Study 2022 \nA1.7 \nThe methodology for quantifying the need for logistics and identifying opportunity areas within \nNottinghamshire has been briefly summarised below.  \n\n\n \n129 \n \n \n \n \nA1.8 \nThe future requirement estimates for future strategic warehousing need was derived through \na number of models:  \n\u2022 \nMDS Transmodal Traffic Growth and Replacement Demand; \n\u2022 \nLabour Demand; Completions Trend;  \n\u2022 \nGross and Net Absorption within Study Area; \n\u2022 \nWider Market \u2013 J24-J28 M1 Net Absorption; and \n\u2022 \nWider Market - L&L and Nottinghamshire Net Absorption \nA1.9 \nA margin equivalent to 5 years completions was applied to the needs models.  \nA1.10 Areas of Opportunity were identified using a criteria based approach \u2013 good connections with \nthe strategic highway, appropriately located to markets to be served, located in an area where \nthere is known under-provision of sites, accessible to labour and close to areas of \nemployment need. \nA1.11 The development of SRFIs was not considered due to the close proximity to East Midlands \nGateway and the planned East Midlands Intermodal Park and the small nature of the study \narea. \n\n\n \n130 \n \n \n \n \nA2.

AGENT AND DEVELOPER ENGAGEMENT \nA4.1 \nThis section summarises feedback we received from engaging with a number of key agents \nand developers (2023). This included Savills, Avison Young, Knight Frank, Tritax Symmetry \nand St Modwen.  \nA4.2 \nKey factors driving demand by location: \n\u2022 \nRoad access is the most important factor for occupiers \u2013 allows for speedy delivery and \ntargets to be met \n\u2022 \nIt is important to consider congestion around junctions as well as distance between site \nand junction; \n\u2022 \n5-10 minute non-congested drive from junction is most appropriate; \n\u2022 \nLack of road infrastructure east of Leicester means it is not attractive for strategic sites; \n\u2022 \nSites using SRFI could be located up to 45-minute drive-time away from the rail head. \n\u2022 \nMotorway is preferrable to A-roads  \n\u2022 \nA42 is more viable for development than A6 \n\u2022 \nSites should not be accessed by routes going through residential areas; \n\u2022 \nAccess to power is vital \u2013 full on-site generation is not viable due to 24/7 nature of \noperations (in terms of solar panels); and \n\u2022 \nRail-served sites have become more attractive due to environmental, social, and corporate \ngovernance ESG requirements. \nA4.3 \nLabour supply comments: \n\u2022 \nAccess to labour is becoming more of a focus due to labour shortages as a result of Brexit; \n\n\n \n133 \n \n \n \n \n\u2022 \nA 20-30 minute drive time/public transport journey is appropriate to consider; \n\u2022 \nCompanies will tend to locate where there is a strong labour supply; \n\u2022 \nGood environment for staff is of growing importance \u2013 need high-quality premises and \ngood accessibility; and \n\u2022 \nSome occupiers may not want to be located on large parks due to having to compete for \nlabour supply \nA4.4 \nMinimum site size comments: \n\u2022 \nNew sites need upwards of 25 ha gross; \n\u2022 \nCould consider sites smaller than 25ha if shape is regular, typography is appropriate and \ninfrastructure costs low; \n\u2022 \nLand is needed for mitigation at sensitive areas i.e. residential; \n\u2022 \nDemand for larger buildings is growing (+25,000 sq.m, up to 100,000 sq.m); and \n\u2022 \nImportant to have a mix of small and large sites to allow for occupier choice \nA4.5 \nLocation specific comments: \n\u2022 \nA6 could accommodate some development however it is notably constrained north of \nLoughborough \n\u2022 \nPrime locations are Lutterworth, Enderby and East Midlands Gateway; \n\u2022 \nOpportunity to extend Mercia Park; and \n\u2022 \nCastle Donnington has good public transport links to Derby and Nottingham and A42 has \ngood links to Tamworth and Burton on Trent  \nA4.6 \nOther comments: \n\n\n \n134 \n \n \n \n \n\u2022 \nBuild to suit has seen a rise recently after two strong years of speculative building; \n\u2022 \nImportant to recycle and refurbish older units where possible as they need to meet the \nlatest criteria e.g. ESG requirements, heights; and \n\u2022 \nConcerns that 2021 warehousing needs study does not use latest data to forecast need \n(i.e. net absorption model used in comparable studies such as SEMLEP) and risks \nunderestimating need \n\n\n \n135 \n \n \n \n \nA5. COUNTY AND NATIONAL HIGHWAYS NOTES \nA5.1 \nIceni Projects engaged with Leicestershire Highways, Warwickshire Highways (written \nfeedback) and National Highways who gave the following feedback about the strategic road \nnetwork in spring 2023 and further feedback in spring 2025: \nOverview \nA5.2 \nNoted methodology limitation - considering junctions and not road corridors as a whole is \nlimiting \u2013 there may be current capacity at junctions but problems on other parts of the \nnetwork i.e. railway bridge on A5 at Hinckley gets struck regularly. \nA5.3 \nRoad Investment Strategy (RIS) 3 (2025-30) pipeline projects in Leicestershire \u2013 National \nHighways only has a commitment to carry out RIS 3 pipeline work and has no other \ncommitments for other schemes currently, including: \n\u2022 \nA5 Hinckley to Tamworth \u2013 wholesale upgrade of corridor, trunk road as standard; \n\u2022 \nLeicester western access \u2013 aimed at solving problems at M1 J21-21A with a smart \nmotorway; and \n\u2022 \nM1 north additional capacity \u2013 smart motorway \u2013 although smart motorways were \nannounced as discontinued in April 2023 \nA5.4 \nAdvised that RIS 3 is now expected to be postponed to RIS 4 (2030-35) \u2013 there is overall \nuncertainty on deliverability. \nA5 \nA5.5 \nHighway Officers indicate that every junction west of the A5 from the M69 interchange has \nsubstantial capacity issues and would require substantial mitigation beyond the public \nhighway boundary. There are frequent accidents and substantial network constraints on the \nA5, in particular between the M1 and M69, of which RIS3 would not address this section. \n\n\n \n136 \n \n \n \n \nThere is a railway bridge between Nuneaton and Hinckley that is struck frequently. National \nHighways are considering a full development stopping order due to the significance of \nconcerns.  \nA5.6 \nTraffic from Magna Park has had a bigger impact on the A5 than the M1. There is substantial \nwarehousing development coming forward at DIRFT, Rugby Gateway and A426 corridor \nwhich connects to the Magna Park/A5 area which will have additional pipeline impacts. \nM1 \nA5.7 \nAs a corridor the M1 functions well. \nA5.8 \nM1 J20 has capacity constraints, housing growth allocations (north east) and issues of \nconnections with local road network, A4303 and route to Magna Park. Is considered an \nopportunity by some stakeholders. \nA5.9 \nJ21 is highly problematic as only access point is Leicester. This may be addressed by J20a, \nhowever there is no definitive proposal as of yet. National Highways said that this junction \ncould be improved through developer contributions and mitigation schemes and would not \nrequire a major projects intervention to unlock development.  \nA5.10 J22 is on a high point and can create an issue with slow moving HGVs due to gradients. \nThere are constraints around J22 which feed into Bardon Hill area despite National Highway \nchanges, traffic from quarries and a signalled gyratory however there is potentially \nopportunity for development. There are some capacity issues on circulatory and off-slip, \nparticularly travelling southbound.  \nA5.11 J23 at Loughborough has further housing growth and Loughborough Science and Enterprise \nPark planned or newly delivered which has created further pressure on the junction. Land \ncapacity and junction capacity likely to be constrained. \n\n\n \n137 \n \n \n \n \nA5.12 J24 has been upgraded however there are still issues and there are challenges in delivering \nmore mitigation. If a robust solution is not delivered then strategic traffic is distributed through \nKegworth and into villages in South Nottingham. The A50 section is considered constrained.  \nA5.13 The M1 south of Leicester has the least traffic issues compared to other junctions in the study \narea and one of the better opportunities on the strategic road network. \n \nM69 \nA5.14 Work done alongside Hinckley NRFI found substantial network capacity issues which may \nnot be possible to mitigate on A5, M69 and M1 J21. Development will potentially impact local \nroad networks as a result.  \nA5.15 Unlocking growth on this corridor will require investment in the strategic road network and co-\nordination. \nA5.16 M69 corridor functions well as a link, however the junctions at either end are heavily \nconstrained. \nA6 \nA5.17 The A6\u2019s inclusion in the study is considered an anomaly as it is not a strategic road, serves \nthe local population and part is single carriageway. There has been no strategic distribution \ndevelopment on this road due to the road network being poor quality, limited land availability \nand prone to flooding.  \nA5.18 Section of A6 between A46 and edge of Loughborough is of a reasonable standard. In terms \nof link and road safety performance there is not a major issue although accessing the M1 \nnorthbound passes through Markfield / Fieldhead which is residential lined for 800m.  \nDeveloper funded improvements could unlock some sites in this area however the \nCharnwood Local Plan has allocated substantial housing growth in this area therefore further \ngrowth may be difficult to accommodate. \n\n\n \n138 \n \n \n \n \nA5.19 Going through Loughborough the strategic road network is not sufficient as it is the \ngeographic spine of the town, running through heavily populated areas. There are also issues \nat Hathern, which is split by the A6 running through it and a traffic signal junction which \ncauses delays.  \nEast Midlands Gateway \nA5.20 From EMG towards the south along A453 towards the airport / EMDC is not a good route due \nto the single, rural lane.  \nA5.21 A453 is main access routes to Donnington Park Motor Circuit and Download Festival \u2013 \ncreates significant traffic management on local roads. \nA5.22 There is a lack of public transport to the area \u2013 most employees come from Leicester and \nNottingham/ Derby.  \nA42 \nA5.23 Overall, there are no severe junction based issues however capacity is limited due to two \nlanes, limited link capacity and lack of resilience in the network when accidents occur.  \nA5.24 The corridor is only two lanes, at least one of which is frequently closed due to accidents.  \nA5.25 Improvements to A42 occurred as a result of Mercia Park, JLR development. \nA5.26 A5 RIS improvements terminate at M42 junction \nA5.27 J24 M1 improvements have helped capacity but difficult to calculate how much extra capacity \ncan be accommodated. \nA5.28 J13 A42 is an issue, which creates further problems at A511 Tesco roundabout and local \nroad network. \n\n\n \n139 \n \n \n \n \nA46 \nA5.29 Improvement works to the A6/A46 junctions have been developer funded.  \nA5.30 The Hobby Horse roundabout is the most congested and delayed junction in the corridor. \nNational Highways reported that the roundabout could only be resolved via a major projects \nintervention and not through developer contributions or mitigation scheme inputs. There is \ncurrently no planned improvements to this junction and it has therefore been \u2018red flagged\u2019. \nA5.31 The A46 / Ratcliffe Road junction layout does not lend itself to high volumes of vehicle \nmovements turning right onto the slip road. Improvements to provide a right turn lane would \npotentially require bridge widening. Ratcliffe Road itself has a 7.5T weight limit.  \n \n \n\n\n \n140 \n \n \n \n \nA6. \nBROAD LOCATION ASSESSMENT CRITERIA \nProximity to the Strategic Road Network \nA6.1 \nProximity to the strategic road network (SRN) is a key consideration for logistics occupiers. \nThere are considerable cost savings associated with junction proximity for logistics occupiers \ngiven the journey time saved for each trip. Additionally, close proximity to strategic road \nnetwork junctions will reduce the impact of HGV movements on the local road network. A \nstrategic distribution site within 1 mile of the strategic road network is considered optimal, \ntherefore the RAG rating is as followed: \n\u2022 \nRed: Access to SRN is beyond 5 miles or access point is over 1 mile from MRN i.e. \u2018A\u2019 \nroad \n\u2022 \nAmber: Access to SRN is within 5 miles but access point is within 1 mile of MRN i.e. \u2018A\u2019 \nroad \n\u2022 \nGreen: Direct access to the SRN or within 1 mile of SRN junction \nJunction Capacity \n\u2022 \nRed = Capacity issues cannot be  mitigated through junction improvements; \n\u2022 \nAmber = Capacity issues can be mitigated through improvements to junction; \n\u2022 \nGreen = No apparent issues / minor delays. No significant upgrades required to unlock \ndevelopment at junction. \nPublic Transport Accessibility \nA6.2 \nBus and train services in proximity to the junction were assessed and scored by the following \nratings: \n\u2022 \nRed = Poor - infrequent bus service (less than 2 per hour); no rail access;  \n\u2022 \nAmber = Adequate - less frequent bus service (up to 3 per hour) within 500m; access to \nrail perhaps through multi-modal journeys (within 3km); and  \n\n\n \n141 \n \n \n \n \n\u2022 \nGreen = Good \u2013 frequent bus service (4 or more per hour) within 500m; proximity to rail \nservices (within 2km).  \nSRFI Access \nA6.3 \nJunctions have then been assessed on their proximity to existing rail freight interchange rail \nheads. This is to assist with identifying preferred locations to meet the rail specific element of \nthe need.  \nA6.4 \nDiscussions with Maritime Transport, operators of East Midlands Gateway rail terminals, \nindicate that they assume an approximate 20-mile drive distance for users of terminals. \nBroadly speaking this means that north of Leicester is covered by EMG whereas south of \nLeicester (including Magna Park Lutterworth) is covered by DIRFT. Birch Coppice also covers \nmuch of west Leicestershire up through the M42/A42.  \nA6.5 \nFor the purpose of the site assessment it has been assumed that a 10-mile distance from a \nrail-freight interchange is considered optimal and so the RAG scoring is as follows: \n\u2022 \nGreen: Within 5 miles of existing rail freight interchange; \n\u2022 \nAmber: Within 5-10 miles of existing rail freight interchange; \n\u2022 \nRed: Over 10 miles away from existing rail freight interchange. \nA6.6 \nThe map below sets out the approximate 10 and 20 miles coverage for Leicester and \nLeicestershire for East Midlands Gateway, Birch Coppice and DIRFT. Only the eastern part \nof the county falls outside of the 20 mile radius from one of the rail interchanges.  \n\n\n \n142 \n \n \n \n \nFigure A6.1: Current Rail Freight Interchange catchment (10 and 20 mile) \n \nLabour Access \nA6.7 \nLabour supply was assessed at a 10 minute and 20 minute drive time level. The 10 minute \nand 20 minute drive time labour supply are each a separate criteria, equally weighted.  \nA6.8 \nThe 10 / 20 minute drive time isochrones are mapped by Iceni using the junction as the central \npoint, and the population catchment is included if the isochrone intersects with the Lower \nSuper Output Area (LSOA). Population data at LSOA level is from the 2021 Census.  \nA6.9 \nEach junction is ranked by the working age population within a 10/20 drivetime and given a \nRAG rating based on: \n\n\n \n143 \n \n \n \n \n\u2022 \nGreen: 10 minute drive time catchment of +100,000; 20 minute catchment of over 400,000 \nworking age population \n\u2022 \nAmber: 10 minute drive time catchment of 50,000-100,000; 20 minute catchement of \n200,000 \u2013 400,000 working age population \n\u2022 \nRed: 10 minute drive time catchment of less than 50,000; 20 minute catchment of less \nthan 200,000 working age population \nCorridor Market Ranking  \nA6.10 For strategic distribution, network accessibility is the optimum factor from a market \nperspective. In this context, road corridors have been ranked at the  \u2018corridor\u2019 level of the AOs \nreflecting their connectivity and market desirability. The need to consider this has also been \nflagged by highways officers. There is a natural hierarchy of the corridors, with the M1 being \na national spine trunk road, M69 a motorway, A42 SRN and A6 as a local route with less \nconnectivity and market desirability. The A42 also has a lower labour market availability within \na shorter drive time. \nA6.11 In order to reflect this corridor ranking, the approach has been developed through stakeholder \ndiscussions and Iceni judgement. It is acknowledged that this is not a wholly objective \nassessment. The assignment of scores is that the best performing corridors rank highest so:  \n\u2022 \nGreen: M1, A50, M69, A46, A5 \n\u2022 \nAmber: A42  \n\u2022 \nRed: A6.  \nSpatial Dynamics \nA6.12 This factor considers the proximity of the assessed sites to existing and proposed settlements \nor employment sites \u2013 sites closer to settlements are more sustainable in terms of labour \naccess and more likely to benefit from sustainable travel to the site. Additionally this factor \nconsiders the spatial impact of the assessed site in terms of sprawl of development. The RAG \nscoring is as below: \n\n\n \n144 \n \n \n \n \n\u2022 \n Green: strong relationship with settlements and employment sites \n\u2022 \nAmber: Nearby settlements and employment sites but some separation \n\u2022 \nRed: Isolated location with poor relationship to settlements and employment sites \nInfrastructure Requirements \nWhere known it is noted what infrastructure requirements or improvements will be required to \nbring the site forward \u2013 this includes strategic road network capacity and junction \nimprovements and local access arrangements. This factor is not scored but is noted within \nthe overall assessment of the site. \n\n\n",

This\npaper forms part of a series of working papers on different aspects\nof planning reform, designed to inform further policy development\nin collaboration with the wider sector.\u00a0\nSummary\u00a0\nThis paper invites views on further action the government should\ntake to speed up homes being built. It sits alongside the\ngovernment\u2019s technical consultation on requiring transparency and\naccountability measures for build out rates on housing sites.\u00a0\u00a0\nWe know that slow build out is of great frustration to many local\nplanning authorities and communities that rightly expect homes,\ninfrastructure and services that have been promised as part of a\nplanning approval to be delivered as quickly as possible. We also\nknow that developers are responsive to commercial incentives and\nbuild out homes at a rate that is beneficial to their business and\nreflective of the wider economic environment.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nThis paper therefore invites views on options the government could\npursue to ensure the right incentives exist in the housing market,\nand local planning authorities have the tools they need, to\nencourage homes to be built out more quickly. In addition to the\ntransparency and accountability measures set out in the technical\nconsultation, this includes incentivising and supporting models of\ndevelopment that build out faster, such as partnership models,\ngreater affordable housing, public sector master-planned sites, and\nsmaller sites. We also invite views on giving local authorities the\nability \u2013 as a last resort \u2013 to charge developers a new \u2018Delayed\nHomes Penalty\u2019 when they fall materially behind pre-agreed build\nout schedules.\u00a0\u00a0\nA series of questions are posed at the end of the paper on which we\nwelcome responses and will consider all views, before determining\nhow and whether these proposals are taken forward.\u00a0\u00a0\nIntroduction\u00a0\n1. As part of the government\u2019s Plan for Change, we are committed\nto delivering 1.5 million homes this Parliament. We have already\ntaken decisive action to increase the number of planning\npermissions granted through our December 2024 updates to the\nNational Planning Policy Framework, including reintroducing\nmandatory targets for the number of new homes and enabling\ndevelopment on low quality \u2018grey belt\u2019 land where housing need\ncannot otherwise be met.\u00a0 We will go even further in the coming\nmonths to streamline the planning system by introducing more\n\u2018rules-based\u2019 national policies for development management,\ncreating a more proportionate statutory consultee system, and\nfinalising our proposed National Scheme of Delegation in relation to\nplanning committees.\u00a0\n2. This faster and more permissive planning system will allow for\nhigher levels of housebuilding by increasing the flow of land into\nthe development system. It is however crucial that permissions for\nhomes in theory become actual homes in practice, as quickly as\npossible.\u00a0\u00a0\n3. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) and others have\n\n\nconcluded that most homes in England are not built as fast as they\ncan be constructed, once permission is granted, but only as fast as\nthe developer expects to sell them at local second-hand market\nprices [footnote 1] .This leads to a build out rate for large sites which\ncan take decades to complete [footnote 2]. While it is commercially\nrational for developers to operate in this way, the systemic impact\nis a lower level of housebuilding than we need. The government is\ntherefore committed to taking firm action to ensure housebuilding\nrates increase to a level that makes housing more affordable for\nworking people.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n4. In the public debate on housebuilding rates, 3 related concepts\nare often confused.\u00a0\na. Land banks are, for the most part, a normal part of the\ndevelopment system. Developers hold a pipeline of sites at all stages\nof the planning process, to avoid stop/starts between schemes. In its\n2024 study, the CMA found no evidence of current land banks\nsystemically distorting competition between housebuilders. We do,\nhowever, have concerns that certain types of contracts over land\nprior to its entry into the planning system (which can be part of\n\u2018strategic\u2019 land banks) can be a barrier to entry for SME developers.\nWe are therefore legislating to make Contractual Control\nAgreements (such as option or promotion agreements) more\ntransparent, to help diversify the industry and reduce barriers to\nentry for SME builders.\u00a0\u00a0\nb. Delayed or stuck sites are those at all stages of the planning and\nbuilding process (including with full planning permission) that are\ndelayed, not building out, or only building out very slowly due to a\nproblem that the developer or landowner is struggling to resolve\nthemselves. Often this is due to the discharge of a planning\ncondition, an issue raised by a statutory consultee, a newly\ndiscovered site issue, or the developer running into financial\ndifficulties. We have created the New Homes Accelerator to tackle\nthis sort of blockage (see Box 1) and get stuck sites moving. In\nwider cases, sites may be stuck in negotiations over suitable S106\ncontributions, sometimes because the promoter has overpaid for the\nland not fully factoring in the policy requirements set out in\nplanning policy. In this paper we consider further reforms to the\n\n\nCompulsory Purchase Order (CPO) process, relevant to stalled\nsites.\u00a0\u00a0\nc. Slow build out is where sites have full planning permission, are\nbeing built, but the pace of building is slower than it could be under\ndifferent development models and incentives. Multiple market\nstudies have found that most large housing sites are built at the\npace the homes can be sold at current second-hand market prices,\nrather than the pace at which they could be constructed if pre-sold\n(i.e. to an institutional landlord). The rate of building consistent\nwith selling at local second-hand market prices is known within the\nindustry as the \u2018absorption rate\u2019. The Letwin Review concluded that\nlocal absorption rates were a \u201cbinding constraint\u201d on build out\nrates. The CMA observed, that \u201cthe private market will not, on its\nown initiative, produce sufficient housing to meet overall housing\nneed, even if it is highly competitive\u201d.\u00a0\nBox 1: New Homes Accelerator\nThe New Homes Accelerator (NHA) is a collaboration between the\ngovernment, Homes England and the Greater London Authority,\nworking with local authorities, developers and other key\nstakeholders to unblock and accelerate the delivery of housing\ndevelopments that are, for various reasons, not progressing as\nquickly as they could be. The NHA is a key component of the\ngovernment\u2019s commitment to deliver 1.5 million new homes by the\nend of this parliament.\nThe New Homes Accelerator will support delayed sites and sites\nwhich are progressing more slowly than they should by leveraging\ngovernment resources and fostering collaboration among key\nstakeholders. We have announced 10 sites, with combined capacity\nfor over 35,900 homes, that will benefit from site-specific\ngovernment support.\nThe Accelerator\u2019s 2024 Call for Evidence, which received responses\non over 350 sites, amounting to around 700,000 homes, identified\nboth systemic problems with the planning and development\nprocess, and site-specific issues. Systemic issues include the role of\nstatutory consultees (and other organisations involved in the\n\n\ndevelopment process), infrastructure delivery, utilities provision\nand environmental factors.\u00a0Through the Accelerator\u2019s collaborative\nengagement with other government departments and statutory\nconsultees, we have already helped move along more than 20,000\nhomes in the planning system.\n5. Government has a clear and primary role in helping to drive\nforward action that addresses delayed or stuck sites and slow build\nout. Slow build out is an important problem because even as we\ngrow the number of planning permissions granted and unblock\ndelayed or stuck sites, the benefits to working families and to the\neconomy are only realised once homes are completed. Ultimately,\nno-one can live in a planning permission. On large sites (sites of\n2,000 or more homes), the median build out rate was recently\nfound to be c.140 homes per year [footnote 3], implying at least 14\nyears from the first build to site completion. The focus this paper is\ntherefore how to:\na) overcome absorption constraints to get more homes built more\nquickly\nb) continue to strengthen the local authority toolkit to unblock\nstalled and stuck sites.\u00a0\u00a0\n6. This is not just a task for government. At the launch of the\ngovernment\u2019s NPPF reforms in July 2024, the housebuilding\nindustry promised to: \u201cwork with local authorities, delivery\npartners and our supply chain to commence construction and build\nout as quickly as possible\u201d. We are clear in our commitment to\ncontinue to support industry and \u2013 in return \u2013 we expect them to\nhold firmly to their commitment.\u00a0\nWhat drives faster build out?\u00a0\n7. Historically and internationally, there are many examples of\ndevelopment happening much faster than it does on most active\nsites currently in England [footnote 4]. The evidence points to many\ninterrelating factors determining the speed of build out.\u00a0\na. The restrictiveness of local planning and the concentration\n\n\nof market power \u2013 recent research has shown that sites are built\nout faster where a local land and planning system is generally less\nrestrictive (i.e. there are more permissions available and fewer\nphysical constraints to building) and where no single firm has\ndominant market power. The researchers argue that this is because\nin markets with more planning permissions available and multiple\nfirms competing, developers do not anticipate as much house price\ngrowth across the construction period and so are incentivised to\nbuild and sell faster, rather than phasing sales (and therefore\nbuilds) [footnote 5].\nb. Local demand \u2013 all else being equal, places with higher demand\nfor new housing see faster rates of market housebuilding [footnote 6].\nThis is simply because more homes can be sold each year at\nprevailing market prices, so developers are prepared to build more\nhomes more quickly to meet that higher demand. Developers\nclosely monitor local sales rates and adjust their build rates, to\navoid holding unsold stock if the sales market softens.\u00a0\nc. Housing typologies \u2013 there are different build out rates and\npatterns for blocks of flats, compared to terraced and detached\nhomes. Flatted developments are harder to slow down mid-build\ncompared to detached homes and are more often debt-financed,\nrequiring a faster return of capital. Over historic interest rate cycles\nthis has meant a \u2018lumpier\u2019 rate of delivery from flats compared to\nschemes primarily composed of houses [footnote 7].\nd. Small sites and SMEs \u2013 absorption constraints are less\npronounced on small sites (typically built by SME firms), as each\nsite represents a much smaller share of an overall local sales\nmarket. The Letwin Review found a \u2018clear, negative\u2026 relationship\nbetween the size of the site and the percentage of the site built out\neach year\u2019 [footnote 8]. SME housebuilders are also less well\ncapitalised than volume developers and so will prioritise a faster\nreturn of capital at a lower margin, meaning that they deliver faster\nbuild out rates.\u00a0\u00a0\ne. Levels of affordable housing \u2013 sites with a higher share of\naffordable housing are built more quickly on average. This is\nbecause homes are sold to registered providers (such as housing\nassociations) in bulk and are then available below market rates e.g.\n\n\nfor social rents or shared ownership. Lichfields found that housing\nschemes with more than 40% affordable housing on site were built\nout at 140 dwellings per year, compared to just 75 dwellings per\nyear for sites with 10-19% affordable housing [footnote 9].\u00a0\u00a0\nf. Mixed tenure \u2013 as well as higher levels of affordable housing,\nthere is evidence that schemes which incorporate an element of\n\u2018Build to Rent\u2019 private rental housing are built faster. Ministry of\nHousing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) analysis of\nplanning pipeline data finds build out rates are 30% to 60% faster\non projects with build to rent compared with non-BTR projects\n[footnote 10]. The Letwin Review found that absorption rate\nconstraints do not apply in the same way on mixed tenure sites as\nfor largely mono-tenure estates.\u00a0\u00a0\n8. In total, the evidence suggests that to raise aggregate build out\nrates across the housing system in England, we will need a strategy\nthat addresses each of these factors, while balancing the risk of\ncreating newly stalled sites from interventions that impact scheme\nviability.\u00a0\u00a0\nOur strategy to speed up build out\u00a0\n9. The government is therefore pursuing a five-part strategy to\nspeed up build out.\u00a0\na. First, continuing with reforms to the planning system \u2013 to\nlower risks and costs, make it more streamlined and rules-based,\nand to increase the flow of land with permission into the system.\nThis includes mandatory housing targets for local planning\nauthorities, a modernised Green Belt policy, and wider changes to\nplanning committees and statutory consultees.\u00a0\u00a0\nb. Second, sustainably supporting demand. This will need to be\ncarefully balanced against the risk of price inflation (a risk which\nplanning reforms should reduce somewhat) and whilst ensuring\nresponsible lending. The government is committed to a permanent,\ncomprehensive Mortgage Guarantee Scheme to ensure a steady\nsupply of low-deposit mortgages to first time buyers across the\nmarket cycle. The Financial Conduct Authority have started work\n\n\non reform of their mortgage regulations to improve access to\nmortgages and support sustainable home ownership alongside\nstrong consumer protection [footnote 11]. Other sources of\nsustainable demand include the successor to the Affordable Homes\nProgramme; a robust Build to Rent sector attracting institutional\ncapital; and strong demand from housing associations for Section\n106 properties.\u00a0\u00a0\nc. Third, supporting the growth of SME developers building\nsmall sites, by tackling the key barriers they face- including timely\nplanning decisions, regulatory burdens, the availability of suitable\nsites and access to finance. Homes granted planning permission\nacross many small sites will typically build out faster than the same\nnumber of homes granted permission on a single large site.\u00a0\u00a0\nd. Fourth, encouraging large, strategic sites to be built with\ngreater tenure diversity, delivering higher shares of affordable\nhousing and Build to Rent homes. Some developers have already\nmoved towards a \u2018partnerships\u2019 model for large sites, which might\ninvolve pre-selling homes to an institutional investor for build to\nrent (as well as pre-sales to Registered Providers for affordable\nhomes) and we want to sustain and encourage the growth of this\nwelcome approach.\u00a0\ne. Fifth, increasing the role for strategic master-planning, in\nparticular through Homes England, new Development Corporations\nand the expanded role for Mayoral Strategic Authorities in spatial\nplanning. By coordinating land assembly, planning and delivery on\nmajor new housing-led developments the public sector can de-risk\ndevelopment and ensure that the right economic and social\ninfrastructure (transport, health, education) is delivered.\nStrategically master-planned large developments can also parcel up\nland for different models of delivery (build to rent, affordable\nhousing, SMEs, self and custom build) which the evidence suggests\nallows faster build rates. This will allow private sector partners to\ncompete to build the homes and infrastructure on a volume and\nquality basis, rather than generating the bulk of their returns\nthrough high risk and high margin land promotion and\ndevelopment.\u00a0\u00a0\n10. The elements described above will form part of the forthcoming\n\n\nLong Term Housing Strategy for England. In addition to setting out\nthis broad strategic approach to speeding up house building, this\nworking paper sets out several further specific policy reforms which\nwould strengthen the incentives on landowners and developers to\nbuild out rapidly, and for local authorities to take action where\nbuild-out rates are unacceptably low.\u00a0\u00a0\nTransparency and Accountability\nMeasures\u00a0\n11. As set out in the government\u2019s technical consultation\naccompanying this working paper, we will take forward measures,\nincluding those provided for in the Levelling-up and Regeneration\nAct (LURA) 2023, to introduce a build-out reporting framework.\nThis framework will involve requirements to:\u00a0\u00a0\na. submit a build out statement with a planning application to\nlocal planning authorities (LPAs)\u00a0\nb. notify LPAs before development is commenced through a\ncommencement notice\nc. report annually to LPAs on housing delivery through a\ndevelopment progress report.\u202fThis will provide a comprehensive\nand consistent picture of build out rates for individual\ndevelopments for the first time.\u00a0\u00a0\n12. We will also implement the new power introduced by section\n113 of the LURA for LPAs to decline to determine planning\napplications made by persons who applied for, or who are\nconnected to, an earlier planning permission for the development of\nland in the LPA\u2019s area which has not been built out at a reasonable\nrate.\u202f This will provide LPAs with an important new sanction to\naddress developers who persistently fail to build out quickly and\ntackle the problem of unscrupulous speculators making repeated\napplications that they have no intention of ever building out.\u00a0\n13. In addition, we are committed to implementing reforms to the\noperation of completion notices introduced under section 112 of the\nLURA.\u00a0 Completion notices require developers to complete their\n\n\ndevelopment within a certain period of time if the LPA considers it\nwill not be completed in a reasonable time, otherwise the planning\npermission will cease \u2013 a form of \u201cuse it or lose it\u201d.\u00a0 The reforms\nwill replace the need for the Secretary of State\u2019s consent for a notice\nwith an appeals mechanism.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nMixed Tenure Thresholds\u00a0\n14. We want to see more housebuilders adopt a partnership model\nand want to incentivise firms to go further and faster. In our\nresponse to the NPPF consultation, we committed to bringing\nforward additional policies to support mixed tenure development,\nincluding a site size threshold above which sites must deliver on a\nmixed tenure basis.\u00a0\u00a0\n15. We are considering a range of options to set the threshold at a\nlevel which balances increasing build out rates, supports broader\nmarket diversification and increases supply overall. The\nIndependent Review of Build Out in 2018 recommended setting the\nthreshold at 1,500 units, but some NPPF consultation responses\nsuggested a lower threshold. As a result, we are considering several\noptions for where to set the threshold, including at 500 units.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n16. We welcome further views on the right threshold \u2013 and on\nwhether and how should be some discretion for Local Planning\nAuthorities \u2013 ahead of further detail on the policy as part of the\nconsultation on National Decision Making Policies and a revised\nNational Planning Policy Framework later this year.\u00a0\nCompulsory Purchase Orders\u00a0\n17. Compulsory purchase is an important tool for ensuring land\nrequired to facilitate development is brought forward in a timely\nmanner, especially where it has not been possible to purchase land\nby agreement and there is a compelling case in the public interest.\u00a0\n18. Many factors contribute to the failure of authorities to purchase\nland by agreement. One factor is where landowners have alternative\nproposals for use of their land. Where landowners can demonstrate\n\n\nthey have alternative, deliverable proposals, this can undermine the\ncompelling case in the public interest for use of a CPO.\u00a0\u00a0\n19. However, on sites which have been stalled over a long period,\nfor example, sites allocated in local plans which do not come\nforward or sites with multiple planning permissions that are never\ncommenced, it is more difficult for landowners to argue, with any\ncertainty, that their alternative proposals could be delivered in a\ntimely manner.\u00a0\u00a0\n20. Furthermore, currently CPOs can only be confirmed, rejected or\nwithdrawn. If a CPO is rejected on the basis a landowner has\nalternative proposals for the land subject to the CPO, but the\nlandowner does not progress their scheme, the authority must re-\nestablish the case for use of a CPO and the CPO process must be re-\ncommenced. This can cause delay and financial implications for\nauthorities.\u00a0\u00a0\n21. Therefore to support use of CPOs on these types of sites, we\nintend to implement a reform introduced by the Levelling-up and\nRegeneration Act 2023 to allow the conditional confirmation of\nCPOs. This will allow the compelling case for use of CPOs to be\nestablished earlier in the land assembly process on sites where\nalternative proposals have been put forward by landowners.\u00a0\u00a0\n22. The conditional confirmation of CPOs could be used to ensure\nlandowners progress their alternative proposals within certain\ntimescales, which would be made clear when an individual CPO is\nconditionally confirmed. Where they fail to do so, CPO powers\ncould then be switched on. We believe the conditional confirmation\npower will de-risk use of CPOs on stalled sites because the existence\nof alternative proposals will no longer carry the same weight in the\ndecision-making process.\u00a0\u00a0\n23. We intend to bring forward the secondary legislation required\nto implement this reform later this year.\u00a0\u00a0\nDelayed Homes Penalty\u00a0\n24. We want to incentivise and encourage models of development\n\n\nwhich allow faster build out, such as greater diversity of tenure.\nWhile we recognise that this is a shift for some parts of the industry,\nwe believe it will benefit all involved \u2013 communities will see homes\nand infrastructure built faster and developers will have more\ncertainty over their sales pipelines.\u00a0\u00a0\n25. To support that shift, and to address instances where build out\nis falling significantly behind the agreed schedule without a\nreasonable justification, we are exploring the possibility of\nintroducing a new tool for local authorities: the \u201cDelayed Homes\nPenalty\u201d. This would effectively be a last resort measure, which we\nhope not to have to implement, but may be needed if industry does\nnot sufficiently adapt and fulfil their commitment to deliver homes\nmore quickly.\u00a0\u00a0\n26. The Delayed Homes Penalty would be available to local\nauthorities for development which falls materially behind pre-\nagreed build out schedules, as set out through the transparency\nmeasures. While subject to further work, including drawing on\nresponses to this working paper, we are considering the following\nframework for the Delayed Homes Penalty.\u00a0\na. The Penalty would apply only to sites over a threshold size and\nonly where there is evidence of a developer falling substantially\nbehind a build out schedule, pre-agreed with the LPA.\u00a0\u00a0\nb. Agreement and monitoring of build out rates would be aligned to\nthe new transparency measures, which will require developers to\npre-agree a build out schedule with the local planning authority\nbefore consent, provide a commencement notice before the\ndevelopment begins and then annual development progress reports.\u00a0\nc. If a site falls substantially behind the pre-agreed build out\nschedule in a given year (to 90% or less of the agreed delivery),\nthen the developer would be required to justify the slower build out\nrate to the planning authority. If this cannot be shown to have been\ncaused by an external factor \u2013 such as unusually severe weather, or\nan unexpected site issues \u2013 the developer could become liable for\nthe Delayed Homes Penalty.\u00a0\nd. The relevant external factors would be nationally set out in\n\n\nguidance and could be informed by those already used in contracts\nbetween Homes England and developers under the \u2018build lease\u2019\nmodel.\u00a0\u00a0\ne. If the Delayed Homes Penalty were applied, the relevant party\n(developer or landowner) would be charged for each home behind\nthe pre-agreed build out schedule. Penalties could be based on a\npercentage of the house price, or via reference to local Council Tax\nrates, given the loss of income that a local authority incurs when\nhomes are not built and occupied at the expected rate (although\nthis would not be applied via the Council Tax system itself).\u00a0\u00a0\n27. It would be important in the introduction of any Delayed Homes\nPenalty that industry was confident in when and how this would be\napplied, to ensure that they did not disincentivise land being\nbrought forward for development. We therefore intend to use all\nviews expressed in response to this working paper to inform further\npolicy development, and if the government decided to take this\nproposal forward, we would propose to undertake further\nconsultation.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nConclusion and questions\u00a0\n28. Slow build out rates on large sites are a concern for local\nplanning authorities, local communities in need of homes and for\nthe government which is seeking to substantially increase\nhousebuilding in England. The measures in this paper propose a\nbalanced approach to speeding up build out, drawing on the\nevidence of what works. We are seeking to push further the existing\ntrend within the industry towards partnership models, through both\npolicy support and by disincentivising a return to the old mono-\ntenure model.\u00a0\u00a0\n29. Before measures are taken forward for further consultation, we\nwelcome views on the principles behind our approach to speeding\nup build out. We are seeking views on:\u00a0\na. Do you agree with the evidence base and theory we have set out\non build out rates?\u00a0\n\n\nb. How could we go further to support models of housebuilding\nwhich build faster, such as small sites, strategically master-planned\nand mixed tenure?\u00a0\nc. For mixed tenure, what would you consider to be an appropriate\nthreshold level?\u00a0\u00a0\nd. Do you have any views on how the proposed CPO measures\nwould work best in practice?\u00a0\ne. How should MHCLG guide local authorities and developers\ntowards reasonable build out schedules (noting that ultimately this\nwill be negotiated locally)?\u00a0\u00a0\nf. What are the right set of exemptions for external factors that\nimpact build out rates? Should this include economic downturns\nwhich reduce sales rates, or does that mean that payments would be\ntoo weak to induce the shift toward the partnerships business\nmodels we want to see?\u00a0\u00a0\ng. For the Delayed Homes Penalty, do you agree with the intention\nto use it to incentivise the shift towards higher build out models of\nhousebuilding?\u00a0\u00a0\nh. How should the Penalty be calculated? What are the strengths\nand weaknesses of using a percentage of house price, or reference to\nlocal council tax rates? What information would local authorities\nrequire?\u00a0\ni. Are there wider options you think worth worthy of consideration\nthat could help speed up build out of housing?\u00a0\nj. Do you anticipate any environmental impacts from these\nproposals that the government must consider and the\nEnvironmental Principles Policy Statement?\u00a0\u00a0\nk. Do you anticipate these proposals giving rise to any impacts on\npeople who share a relevant protected characteristic, as defined by\nthe Equality Act 2010, that the government must consider under the\nPublic Sector Equality Duty?\n1. 2024, CMA, Housebuilding Market Study \u2013 Final Report,\n\n\np.52; 2018, Letwin, Independent Review of Build Out Draft\nAnalysis p.11; 2024, Lichfields, From Start to Finish 3, p.17\u00a0\u21a9\n2.
