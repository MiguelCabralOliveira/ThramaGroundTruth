The sector is defined as multi-let industrial estates and business parks made up of small-to-medium bays/units (typical unit sizes ~1,000\u201330,000 sq ft) used for light industrial, small-scale manufacturing, trade counter, and B8/B2 logistics (including last-mile distribution for SMEs).\n\nGeography and segmentation\n- National UK coverage with regional segmentation and focused coverage of major investment and occupational markets: Greater London & South East (including Thames Valley), East of England, South West, Midlands (West & East), North West (Manchester/Liverpool), Yorkshire & Humber, Scotland (Glasgow/Edinburgh), and Northern Ireland.\n- Segment analysis by:\n  - Unit size bands (e.g., <5,000 sq ft, 5,000\u201315,000 sq ft, >15,000 sq ft).\n  - Grade/quality (prime vs secondary multi-let estates).\n  - Location type (inner-city/last-mile, suburban business park, industrial estate).\n  - Tenant type (e-commerce/fulfilment SME, trade/retail/contractor, light manufacturing).\n\nTemporal context\n- Treat \u201crecent trends\u201d as the last 12\u201324 months up to 2026-01-06.\n- Include historic context covering the prior 3\u20135 years where relevant to show cycle dynamics.\n\nRequired deliverables and structure\n1. Executive summary (1\u20132 pages)\n   - Key investment conclusions, recommended positioning (buy/hold/sell), headline yields and expected returns, and primary risks.\n\n2. Market size & growth\n   - Current market size (sq ft and estimated market value) of the UK multi-let light industrial stock and recent growth rates (annual and CAGR where possible).\n   - Leasing / take-up volumes (sq ft) for the last 12 and 24 months and 3-year trend.\n   - Rental levels (headline rents and effective rents per sq ft) by region and unit-size band, plus historical change over the last 12\u201324 months.\n\n3. Supply & demand dynamics\n   - Vacancy rates and trends by region and unit size.\n   - Development pipeline (under construction and consented schemes) relevant to multi-let product, including expected completions over the next 24 months.\n   - Net absorption and demand drivers (e-commerce, SME growth/decline, manufacturing reshoring, supply chain changes, structural changes in retail).\n   - Barriers to supply (planning constraints, construction costs, land availability).\n\n4. Investment yields & pricing\n   - Current prime and secondary net initial yields / equivalent cap rates by region and by unit size/grade (as of 2026-01-06).\n   - Recent transaction volume (12\u201324 months), major portfolio and single-asset transactions with pricing and yields where available.\n   - Movement in capital values over the last 12\u201324 months and yield compression/expansion patterns.\n   - Typical lease structures and WAULTs for multi-let assets and how they influence pricing.\n\n5. Returns and performance metrics\n   - Typical expected returns (gross/net) and modelling of total returns under a range of assumptions.\n   - Sensitivity analysis to rental growth, vacancy, and discount rates/interest-rate shifts.\n   - Comparison against single-let big-box logistics and broader industrial sector performance.\n\n6. Major players and market structure\n   - Active investors and owners (institutional investors, REITs, specialist funds, private equity, developers) and their strategies.\n   - Key brokers, valuers and data providers to cite (MSCI, CBRE, JLL, Savills, Knight Frank, CoStar, EG, CoStar).\n\n7. Risks & mitigants\n   - Macro risks: interest rates/financing environment, economic slowdown/recession risk, inflation.\n   - Sector-specific risks: oversupply in target locations, obsolescence (EPC/energy performance), tenant concentration, shorter lease lengths.\n   - Regulatory and policy risks: planning reform, business rates, environmental regulations.\n   - Physical/climate risks: flood, heat, transition risk (decarbonisation costs).\n   - For each risk identify pragmatic mitigants and suggested asset management/underwriting approaches.\n\n8. ESG / sustainability considerations\n   - EPC trends and requirements for industrial estates, retrofit capex expectations, net-zero transition implications.\n   - Investor expectations and tenant requirements (EV charging, solar, energy efficiency).\n   - Potential impact on valuations and leasing.\n\n9. Forecast & outlook\n   - 3-year and 5-year forecasts (base, upside, downside scenarios) for rents, vacancy, yields and transaction volumes.\n   - Forecast assumptions clearly stated (GDP growth, interest rates, inflation, e-commerce growth rates, construction costs).\n\n10. Investment recommendations & strategy\n    - Tactical and strategic recommendations (target regions, unit sizes, pricing bands, yield spreads vs prime logistics).\n    - Preferred acquisition criteria (lot sizes, WAULT, tenant mix), target returns (IRR, cash yield), and recommended hold vs park-and-sell horizons.\n    - Suggested asset management playbook (leasing strategies, reconfiguration, ESG upgrades, income enhancement opportunities).\n\n11. Due diligence checklist and practical considerations\n    - Legal, planning, environmental, lease, and technical diligence points specific to multi-let light industrial units.\n    - Typical capex budgeting allowances (tenant roll/void refurbishments, EPC improvements, estate works).\n\n12. Appendices & data\n    - Data sources, methodology and assumptions.\n    - Tables: regional rent & yield matrix, vacancy and take-up figures, development pipeline schedule, transaction comps (last 24 months).\n    - Raw data spreadsheet (CSV/XLS) with core inputs and time series where permitted.\n\nAnalytical requirements / expectations\n- Use and cite authoritative sources (MSCI/Index providers, CBRE, JLL, Savills, Knight Frank, CoStar, Land Registry, ONS, VOA, HMLR, local planning portals).\n- Provide transaction evidence for yield and pricing statements (minimum 8\u201312 comparable transactions over last 24 months).\n- Show calculations for yield, total return and sensitivity scenarios; include assumptions for discount rates and terminal value.\n- Highlight any data gaps or areas of uncertainty.\n\nFormat and delivery\n- Deliver a concise written report (~15\u201325 pages) plus a 10\u201312 slide investment deck summarising key findings.\n- Provide an accompanying Excel workbook with the data tables, assumptions and sensitivity models.\n- Include an executive summary slide/document that can be shared with investment committee members.\n\nTiming\n- If possible, deliver a first draft within 7 business days and a final version within 10\u201314 business days depending on data accessibility.\n\nNotes / constraints\n- Keep recommendations actionable for institutional or private equity real estate investors (acquisition and asset management focus).\n- Avoid high-level generalities; prioritise quantified metrics and transaction-backed evidence.\n- If up-to-date national or regional yield/rent data is unavailable, provide reasoned ranges and clearly flag those as estimates with justification.\n\nEnd of brief \u2014 maintain the user's original objective (investment analysis of the UK multi-let light industrial facilities sector) while addressing the above sections and outputs.",
